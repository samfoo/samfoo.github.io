# Goals for 2017

## Meta

* [ ] Revisit this plan once a quarter and adjust as necessary.
    *Failed to revisit :-(*

## Health

* [x] Completely stop drinking.
    * [x] Zero-alcohol beer as a substitute is good.
    * [x] Avoid situations that expect drinking.

    *Super successful. Not going to start drinking again.*

## Finance &amp; Professional Life

### Finances

Now that ZoÃ« is more stable financially, and I am in prime earning years, the
focus for the next several years is to build as much of a nest egg as
possible.

Generally this means:

* [x] No big purchase.
    *Didn't make any serious purchases outside some required household items.*
* [x] Reducing current high-budget areas (rent not-withstanding). For 2016 the
  top 5 areas were:
    *Kick-ass reduction in non-rent spending, but there's still room for
    improvement.*

| Category                        | Amount |
|---------------------------------|--------|
| Dining/Restaurants              | $6000  |
| Medical expenses                | $5000  |
| Cash spending (ATM withdrawals) | $4400  |
| Auto maintenance/Petrol         | $4000  |
| Recreation/Hobbies              | $3600  |

* [x] Have $200k liquidity by EOY 2017.
    * [ ] Move $100k into ETF/passive-managed fund.
        *Worry about short-term volatility has prevented me from investing
        heavily outside of HISA*

* [ ] Spend less than $100/mo dining out on average.
    *Average was ~$300/mo. Still better than last year. Would have been much
    better w/o Bennelong and travel*
* [ ] Place entire bonus in an ETF/passive-managed fund.
    *See above worry RE: short-term volatility*
* [x] Save $5000/mo on average
    * [x] $60k from income per year
        *Not exactly $5000/mo, but extremely close (4.5k/mo)*

### Professional Life

* [x] Take a team leadership role by the end of the year
* [ ] Write more C++ than Go or Python
* [x] Be happy with work

## Hobbies and Doing Stuff

### BJJ

Coming back to BJJ is going to be hard, but already in only being 3 weeks
back, I've remembered what the itch is again. This year is about setting
myself up for a blackbelt in ~2 years.

I am to be okay with not competing. The risk of injury isn't worth it.

* [x] Have a serious-injury free year.
* [ ] Keep a training journal.
* [ ] Train 3 times a week.
    *Trained closer to 2 times a week. I don't think this is likely to change.
    Work constraints, life constraints, and injury risk prevent doing this more
    often.*

### Surfing

Surfing is a great "new" hobby. The focus is on having fun, and enjoying it -
not on getting better.

* [ ] Surf 2 times a week (conditions permitting).
* [x] Continue having fun.
    *Sadly, not even close.*

### Swimming

* [ ] Swim at least once a week
    * [ ] Start @ 1km
    * [ ] @1.5kms by July
    * [ ] @2kms by 2018
    *Also, not even close.*

## Reading and Learning

Heaps of downtime is spent doing useless crap. Curbing that crap is really
important. Books are one method of avoiding crap.

Last year, the book goal was a failure, though the distribution per-month got
much closer to 3 than 2015. This year's goal is the same as last year's.

* [x] Read more books.
    * [ ] 36 books (3 / mo.)
        *Read 30 books (trailed off towards the end of the year).*
    * [ ] 2 professional books
        *Read 1 professional book*
    * [ ] 10 non-fiction (not counting the above)
        *Read 5 non-fiction books*

* [x] Waste less time on fast food internet
    * [ ] Stop reading reddit in the mornings before getting out of bed.
        *Sadly still on it :-( Have stopped reading comments by blocking them
        on my phone, though.*
    * [x] Absolutely no:
        * [x] Politics
        * [x] Reading comments, but not article

* [ ] Get out more
    * [ ] Go to museums 6 times
        *Not even close. I think we went probably twice*
