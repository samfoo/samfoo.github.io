# Goals for 2017

## Meta

Revisit this plan once a quarter and adjust as necessary.

## Health

* Completely stop drinking.
    * Zero-alcohol beer as a substitute is good.
    * Avoid situations that expect drinking.

## Finance &amp; Professional Life

### Finances

Now that ZoÃ« is more stable financially, and I am in prime earning years, the
focus for the next several years is to build as much of a nest egg as
possible.

Generally this means:

* No big purchase.
* Reducing current high-budget areas (rent not-withstanding). For 2016 the
  top 5 areas were:

| Category                        | Amount |
|---------------------------------|--------|
| Dining/Restaurants              | $6000  |
| Medical expenses                | $5000  |
| Cash spending (ATM withdrawals) | $4400  |
| Auto maintenance/Petrol         | $4000  |
| Recreation/Hobbies              | $3600  |

* Have $200k liquidity by EOY 2017.
    * Move $100k into ETF/passive-managed fund.
* Spend less than $100/mo dining out on average.
* Place entire bonus in an ETF/passive-managed fund.
* Save $5000/mo on average
    * $60k from income per year

### Professional Life

* Take a team leadership role by the end of the year
* Write more C++ than Go or Python
* Be happy with work

## Hobbies and Doing Stuff

### BJJ

Coming back to BJJ is going to be hard, but already in only being 3 weeks
back, I've remembered what the itch is again. This year is about setting
myself up for a blackbelt in ~2 years.

I am to be okay with not competing. The risk of injury isn't worth it.

* Have a serious-injury free year.
* Keep a training journal.
* Train 3 times a week.

### Surfing

Surfing is a great "new" hobby. The focus is on having fun, and enjoying it -
not on getting better.

* Surf 2 times a week (conditions permitting).
* Continue having fun.

### Swimming

* Swim at least once a week
    * Start @ 1km
    * @1.5kms by July
    * @2kms by 2018

## Reading and Learning

Heaps of downtime is spent doing useless crap. Curbing that crap is really
important. Books are one method of avoiding crap.

Last year, the book goal was a failure, though the distribution per-month got
much closer to 3 than 2015. This year's goal is the same as last year's.

* Read more books.
    * 36 books (3 / mo.)
    * 2 professional books
    * 10 non-fiction (not counting the above)

* Waste less time on fast food internet
    * Stop reading reddit in the mornings before getting out of bed.
    * Absolutely no:
        * Politics
        * Reading comments, but article

* Get out more
    * Go to museums 6 times
