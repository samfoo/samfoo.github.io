    <h3>What is Shitty Book Club?</h3>

    <p>
    "Shitty Book Club" is a forum in which friends from around the world
    celebrate "terrible" literature. This can be anything from poorly written,
    whimsical absurdity, horrible racism, cringy displays of sex or horrible
    contrived plot.
    </p>

    <p>
    Most of the time a book is "all of the above"
    </p>

    <h3>When is the next Shitty Book Club?</h3>

    <p>
    We don't have a fixed schedule. We rotate who chooses the next book each
    session and that person is responsible for scheduling a call. We usually
    have a video call for about and hour to review each book. The video call is
    organised on Google Hangouts.
    </p>

                            No one gets in without being asked. And with her
                            untamable hair, large forehead, and gawky body,
                            Tookie De La Cr√®me isn't expecting an invitation.
                            Modelland--the exclusive, mysterious place on top
                            of the mountain--never dares to make an appearance
                            in her dreams.
                            <br/><br/>

                            But someone has plans for Tookie. Before she can
                            blink her mismatched eyes, Tookie finds herself in
                            the very place every girl in the world obsesses
                            about. And three unlikely girls have joined her.
                            <br/><br/>

                            Only seven extraordinary young women become
                            Intoxibellas each year. Famous. Worshipped.
                            Magical. What happens to those who don't make it?
                            Well, no one really speaks of that. Some things are
                            better left unsaid.
                            <br/><br/>

                            Thrown into a world where she doesn't seem to
                            belong, Tookie glimpses a future that could be
                            hers--if she survives the beastly Catwalk Corridor
                            and terrifying Thigh-High Boot Camp. Or could it?
                            Dark rumors like silken threads swirl around the
                            question of why Tookie and her new friends were...
