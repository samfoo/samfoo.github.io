    <h3>What is Shitty Book Club?</h3>

    <p>
    "Shitty Book Club" is a forum in which friends from around the world
    celebrate "terrible" literature. This can be anything from poorly written,
    whimsical absurdity, horrible racism, cringy displays of sex or horrible
    contrived plot.
    </p>

    <p>
    Most of the time a book is "all of the above"
    </p>

    <h3>When is the next Shitty Book Club?</h3>

    <p>
    We don't have a fixed schedule. We rotate who chooses the next book each
    session and that person is responsible for scheduling a call. We usually
    have a video call for about and hour to review each book. The video call is
    organised on Google Hangouts.
    </p>

                          The weather beaten trail wound ahead into the dust
                          racked climes of the baren land which dominates large
                          portions of the Norgolian empire. Age worn hoof
                          prints smothered by the sifting sands of time shone
                          dully against the dust splattered crust of earth. The
                          tireless sun cast its parching rays of incandescense
                          from overhead, half way through its daily revolution.
                          Small rodents scampered about, occupying themselves
                          in the daily accomplishments of their dismal lives.
                          Dust sprayed over three heaving mounts in blinding
                          clouds, while they bore the burdonsome cargoes of
                          their struggling overseers.

                          Prepare to embrace your creators in the stygian
                          haunts of hell, barbarian, gasped the first soldier.

                          Only after you have kissed the fleeting stead of
                          death, wretch! returned Grignr.
