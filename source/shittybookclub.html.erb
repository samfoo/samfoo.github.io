    <h3>What is Shitty Book Club?</h3>

    <p>
    "Shitty Book Club" is a forum in which friends from around the world
    celebrate "terrible" literature. This can be anything from poorly written,
    whimsical absurdity, horrible racism, cringy displays of sex or horrible
    contrived plot.
    </p>

    <p>
    Most of the time a book is "all of the above"
    </p>

    <h3>When is the next Shitty Book Club?</h3>

    <p>
    We don't have a fixed schedule. We rotate who chooses the next book each
    session and that person is responsible for scheduling a call. We usually
    have a video call for about and hour to review each book. The video call is
    organised on Google Hangouts.
    </p>

                            <p class="desc">
                            Days after winning OASIS founder James Halliday’s
                            contest, Wade Watts makes a discovery that changes
                            everything.
                            <br/><br/>

                            Hidden within Halliday’s vaults, waiting for his
                            heir to find, lies a technological advancement that
                            will once again change the world and make the OASIS
                            a thousand times more wondrous—and addictive—than
                            even Wade dreamed possible.
                            <br/><br/>

                            With it comes a new riddle, and a new quest—a last
                            Easter egg from Halliday, hinting at a mysterious
                            prize.
                            <br/><br/>

                            And an unexpected, impossibly powerful, and
                            dangerous new rival awaits, one who’ll kill
                            millions to get what he wants.
                            <br/><br/>

                            Wade’s life and the future of the OASIS are again
                            at stake, but this time the fate of humanity also
                            hangs in the balance.
                            <br/><br/>

                            Lovingly nostalgic and wildly original as only
                            Ernest Cline could conceive it, Ready Player Two
                            takes us on another imaginative, fun, action-packed
                            adventure through his beloved virtual universe, and
                            jolts us thrillingly into the future once again.
