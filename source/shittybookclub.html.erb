    <h3>What is Shitty Book Club?</h3>

    <p>
    "Shitty Book Club" is a forum in which friends from around the world
    celebrate "terrible" literature. This can be anything from poorly written,
    whimsical absurdity, horrible racism, cringy displays of sex or horrible
    contrived plot.
    </p>

    <p>
    Most of the time a book is "all of the above"
    </p>

    <h3>When is the next Shitty Book Club?</h3>

    <p>
    We don't have a fixed schedule. We rotate who chooses the next book each
    session and that person is responsible for scheduling a call. We usually
    have a video call for about and hour to review each book. The video call is
    organised on Google Hangouts.
    </p>

                          Sandberg is chief operating officer of Facebook and
                          coauthor of Option B with Adam Grant. In 2010, she
                          gave an electrifying TED talk in which she described
                          how women unintentionally hold themselves back in
                          their careers. Her talk, which has been viewed more
                          than six million times, encouraged women to “sit at
                          the table,” seek challenges, take risks, and pursue
                          their goals with gusto.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                          Lean In continues that conversation, combining
                          personal anecdotes, hard data, and compelling
                          research to change the conversation from what women
                          can’t do to what they can. Sandberg provides
                          practical advice on negotiation techniques,
                          mentorship, and building a satisfying career. She
                          describes specific steps women can take to combine
                          professional achievement with personal fulfillment,
                          and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting
                          women both in the workplace and at home.
