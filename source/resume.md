## Background

I enjoy building things. From software and hardware, to business development, I
am a builder.

I've worked across a range of industries and domains, including: several
successful startups, financial institutions, media companies, and retail.

I'm excited about recent developments that make embedded electronics more
accessible and am an enthusiast of open source.

## Experience

### ThoughtWorks (Australia, India, South Africa, New Zealand)
#### Lead Developer Consultant - Semptember 2011 - present

ThoughtWorks is a global IT consulting firm. Their portfolio is focused on
large telecommunication, financial services and insurance. They're well know
evangelists of continuous delivery, Agile, and extreme programming.

I worked in a wide-variety of roles, from developer to tech-lead to coach,
which all involved a wide-variety of technologies and techniques.

* Led a large team as a tech lead in a year long project to deliver a new
application for financial advisers to assist in onboarding their clients to a
wealth management platform. Overcome substantial enterprise integration
challenges, and helped transition a project with poor test automation to an
exemplar in quality for the rest of the program. Mostly JavaScript and Java
(Spring MVC).

* Led a team at one of the Australia's largest retailers helping them roll out
a continuous delivery practice proof of concept, on an unusual set of
technologies, including: AIX, HPUX, with C, C++, PL/SQL, and Java. Integrated
proprietary unix builds into continuous integration, as well as rolling out
test automation for projects completely lacking them.

* Capability development lead for South African offie. This included
on-boarding technical new hires, developing training material, organising
conference speaking and attendance for the technical staff, and
identifying/addressing specific skill gaps by bringing in external resources.

* Tech lead for two (real estate, and comparison shopping) pre-funding
Sydney-based start-us. Both startups raised large seed rounds, and succesfully
exited.

* Co-developed ThoughtWorks LevelUp - a teaching program for university
students who want to get real-world experience. It now runs in four different
countries and has had over 1000 students.

* Worked on an off-shorered team delivering an online dating app for a
large UK newspaper in Scala and Python. Focused on a more sophisticated
matching algorithm.

Socrata develops a platform for publishing Government data beautifully.

I was a very early stage employee and had the opportunity to work on many
different projects.

querying tens of millions of events. Used for customer and business facing
metrics.

* Created a "real-time" browser messaging infrastructure that enabled
cooperative editing of spreadsheet-like documents by many individuals.

then Java to Scala. I was also the company champion of automated testing.

for two years.
