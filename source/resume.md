## Abstract

I enjoy building things.

I've worked across a range of industries &amp; domains, including: several
successful startups, large financial institutions, media companies, airlines,
and retail.

I'm a zealous enthusiast of open source.

## Experience

### [Optiver Asia Pacific](http://optiver.com) (Australia)
#### Software Engineer - January 2016 - Present

#### Lead Developer Consultant - September 2011 - November 2015

* Continuous delivery enterprise strategy lead for a worldclass air carrier in
New Zealand.

* Led a team of 20+ at a large Australian bank in a year long project to
deliver an application for financial advisers to onboard clients to a wealth
management platform. Overcame substantial enterprise integration challenges,
and helped transition a project with poor test automation to an exemplar in
quality for the rest of the program. Mostly JavaScript and Java (Spring MVC).

* Led a team at one of the Australia's largest retailers producing
a continuous delivery proof of concept on an unusual set of technologies,
including: AIX, HPUX, with C, C++, PL/SQL, and Java.

* Head of capability development for South Africa. This included
on-boarding technical new hires, developing training material, organising
conference speaking and attendance for the technical staff, and
identifying/addressing specific skill gaps by bringing in external resources.

* Tech lead for two (real estate, and comparison shopping) pre-funding
Sydney-based start-us. Both startups raised large seed rounds, and succesfully
exited.

* Co-created [LevelUp](http://levelup.thoughtworks.com) &mdash; a teaching program
for university students interested in technology. It now runs in four different
countries and has had thousands of students.

* Worked off-shore with a team delivering an online dating app for a
large UK newspaper in scala and python. Focused on a more sophisticated
matching algorithm and search mechanism.

### [Socrata](http://socrata.com) (Seattle)
#### Software Engineer - December 2007 to July 2011

* Developed a cassandra-backed time-series database for aggregating and
querying tens of millions of events. Used for customer and business facing
metrics.

* Created a "real-time" browser messaging infrastructure that enabled
cooperative editing of spreadsheet-like documents by many individuals.

* Involved in transitioning a legacy codebase from Ruby (Rails 2) to Java and
then Java to Scala. I was also the company champion of automated testing.

* Successfully worked (telecommuting) while traveling across five continents
for two years.

### [Thriva / The Active Network](http://www.activenetwork.com) (Seattle)
#### Software Engineer - April 2006 to October 2007

* Created a reporting interface that allowed registrants and customers
to create their own name tags, and create arbitrary reports as either PDF or
HTML.

* Introduced modern source control, continuous integration and testing
practices.

* Championed a transition to a service oriented design/architecture.
