# Goals for 2020

## Vision

* [ ] Be healthier, mentally and physically, by systematically taking
  care of myself. Less stress, more joy.
* [ ] Expand my mind by applying myself to some kind of artistic
  endeavour.

## Health

* [ ] Exercise at least twice a week. Set targets for fitness and/or strength.
* [ ] Don't immediately reach for the phone in any moment of boredom or
  inattention.
  * [ ] Reduce screen time, even counting commuting to less than 1 hour per day
    on average during the week.
  * [ ] On the weekend, prefer books, videogames, or anything else to reading
    reddit or hackernews.

### Art

* [ ] Do some kind of art (any kind) at least 2 times per month.
