# Goals for 2019

## Top 3

* [ ] Be healthier, mentally and physically, by systematically taking
  care of myself.
* [x] Reduce mortgage debt and de-risk general expenses aggressively.
* [ ] Expand my mind by applying myself to some kind of artistic endeavour.

## Health

I will not allow malaise to prevent me from trying new things and stepping out
of my comfort zone.

### Self-Care

I have never been studious at maintaining myself. Self-care is symbolic of my
internal valuation of myself. In improving that valuation is to improve my
self-care. Last year, I did this with flossing and brushing. This year, I will
do it with haircare and journaling.

* [x] Floss (almost) every day.
* [x] Shave (almost) every day, and maintain a neat haircut.
* [ ] Maintain a journal. Write at least 2 entries per week.
* [x] Exercise regularly.
  * [x] Run, swim or cycle at least twice per week. Record the sessions.
  * [ ] Participate in 1 public event (city2surf, city2gong, etc)

### Finances

The last few years of finance have been focused solely on buying a house. Now
that we've accomplished that, what's next? We're overexposed to the property
market and should be looking to pay down our debt as quickly as possible.

Additionally, I need to start thinking more about retirement, and planning for
my long term financial situation. This means looking at wills, considering
super plans, etc.

* [x] Have under $1mm in debt remaining on the house (roughly 7 years ahead on
  payment schedule)
* [ ] Create a legal will.
* [ ] Move my super to Australia Super, and consolidate my AMP plans there.
  * [ ] Confirm life insurance is comparable.
  * [ ] Confirm any other remaining features on AMP are not important.

### Art

Some years have gone by with a token goal towards improving some kind of
artistic talent. These have always been de-prioritised. Often then neglect has
been because of my own insecurities about doing something that I don't think
I'm naturally good at.

This year I will commit to practicing art regularly.

* [ ] Do some kind of art (any kind) at least 2 times per week. Track
  this by using a calendar.
