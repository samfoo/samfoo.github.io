# Bored? Here's some project ideas

## Coding

* IRC client that doesn't blow
    IRC clients are largely crap and don't generally have features that I
    actually care about. A client based on electron that has a UI similar to
    Slack or HipChat would greatly improve my IRC experience.

    * Support for inline images and link previews
    * Support for emoji's
    * Less noise more signal (e.g. `samfoo (samfoo@moz-baii8t.dsl.ncf.ca) joined the channel` - who cares!?)
* Babushka re-written in go
    Better portability, easier to setup, learn go.
* [Assertions / Expectations in Rust that aren't crap](http://github.com/samfoo/oxidize)
    Assertions in rust aren't great, write a library that does something like
    AssertJ or Hamcrest or Chai.

    Current status: Needs better error messages.
* "Google Alerts" for Australian legislation
    Subscribe to words that you'd like to be alerted to when legislation goes
    in front of the house or senate. Get email alerts when bills that have that
    language get added.

## Writing

* The Rust Testing Guide
    Rust testing is a bit of a black art. Dependency injection isn't
    immediately obvious, nor is common things like mocking/stubbing. Write a
    series of articles outlining some approaches for writing tests/testable
    code in rust.
