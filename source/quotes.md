# Memorable Quotes

"I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s
brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and
died in cotton fields and sweatshops."

<div class="attrib">- Stephen Jay Gould</div>

"Anyone whose goal is 'something higher' must expect some day to suffer
vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? Then why do we feel it even when
the observation tower comes equipped with a sturdy handrail? No, vertigo is
somethin other than the fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness
below us which tempts and allures us, it is the desire to fall against
which, terrified, we defend ourselves."

<div class="attrib">- Milan Kundera, <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></div>

"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a
hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a
wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act
alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a
computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization
is for insects."

<div class="attrib">- Robert Heinlein, <em>Time Enough For Love</em></div>

"We want to be loved; failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing
that, hated and despised. At all costs we want to stir up some sort of feeling
in others. Our soul abhors a vacuum. At all costs it longs for contact."

<div class="attrib">- Hjalmar Söderberg, <em>Doktor Glas</em></div>
