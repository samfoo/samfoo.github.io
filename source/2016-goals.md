# Goals for 2016

## Hobbies and Doing Stuff

**Get better at what you do, and find something totally new.**

* Start a new hobby

    ### Current hobbies
    * Canyoning
    * Climbing
    * Hiking
    * 4WD
    * Cooking

    ### Ideas
    * [x] Surfing
        *Been surfing consistently all year (barring surgery times). Have
        gotten heaps better. This is definitely a success.*

    * [x] Drawing
        *First half of the year I was very consistent, and then tailed off. I
        think I need to get back into it.*

    * [ ] Painting
        *Started out with a big job, never finished*

    * [ ] Creative writing
        *Did nothing*

* Improve existing hobbies
    * [ ] Climb at least Ewbank 25 outdoors, sport
        *Have effectively quit climbing due to breaking my leg*

    * [x] Exercise 2-3 time per week
        *Did really well while not in the "surgery zone". Both surfing and
        swimming were happening at least 2 times a week all year.*

    * [x] 4WD trip with only ZoÃ« 4 times this year
        *The Fraser trip knocked this one out of the park.*

    * [ ] Improve cooking repertoire
        * [ ] Learn to cook at least 3 desserts
        * [ ] Learn at least 1 ethnic meal well enough to cook without a recipe

* [ ] Do at least one "art" a month.
    * [ ] Do 1 piece of digital art.
    * [ ] Sketch 1 thing a week.

## Learning and Media Consumption

**Produce more, consume less. Don't burn cycles on fast-food consumption, no
matter how tempting it is.**

* [ ] Read more books

    Finished 31 books (exceeding the goal of 24) in 2015. For 2016 continue
    to improve:

    * [ ] 36 books (3 / mo.)
        *Only finished 28 (2.33 / mo.). I think this goal was frustrated
        again by "fast food internet". I'm really not sure how to overcome
        that.*

    * [ ] 5 professional books
        *Not even close :-(*

    * [ ] 15 non-fiction (not counting the above)
        *Not even close :-(*

* [ ] Waste less time on fast food internet
    * [ ] Stop reading reddit in the mornings before getting out of bed.
    * [ ] Casual internet reading should be Wikipedia, perhaps installing an
      app would help?

* [ ] Go live
    * [ ] At least 1 small music gig
    * [ ] At least 2 plays / theatre productions
    * [ ] At least 1 festival of some kind

## Work and Programming

**Be satisfied and successful with the new job.**

* [x] Be professionally successful
    * [ ] Attend at least 1 user group a month
    * [ ] Write at least 1 article per quarter
    * [x] Continue contributing to open source

* [ ] Launch canyons.io and market it
    * [ ] By the end of the year, the canyoning community in Sydney should be
      looking to canyons.io for all trip reports and canyon guides.

      *While this didn't work for canyons.io, it was relatively successful
      for liveheats.com. Heaps of time and effort led to it being one of the
      leading surf organisation tools.*

## Misc.

**Be less selfish. Be more mindful. Be more organised. Accept people for who
they are.**

* [x] Apply for Australian Citizenship
    * [x] Don't leave the country

* [x] Communicate more with friends apropos of nothing.
    * [x] Send at least 1 "out-of-nowhere" email a month.
    * [x] See a non-work colleague in a non-work setting, and don't talk about
      work at least 1 time a month.
    * [ ] Get coffee with a non-work colleague 1 time a month.

* [ ] Use a calendar for everything.

* [ ] Do Ludum Dare with friends at least once. Make a fun game.
