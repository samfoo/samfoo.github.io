<h1>Goals for 2017</h1>

<h2>Meta</h2>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Revisit this plan once a quarter and adjust as necessary.
<em>Failed to revisit :-(</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Health</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>[x] Completely stop drinking.</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] Zero-alcohol beer as a substitute is good.</li>
<li>[x] Avoid situations that expect drinking.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Super successful. Not going to start drinking again.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Finance &amp; Professional Life</h2>

<h3>Finances</h3>

<p>Now that ZoÃ« is more stable financially, and I am in prime earning years, the
focus for the next several years is to build as much of a nest egg as
possible.</p>

<p>Generally this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] No big purchase.
<em>Didn&#39;t make any serious purchases outside some required household items.</em></li>
<li>[x] Reducing current high-budget areas (rent not-withstanding). For 2016 the
top 5 areas were:
<em>Kick-ass reduction in non-rent spending, but there&#39;s still room for
improvement.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>| Category                        | Amount |
|---------------------------------|--------|
| Dining/Restaurants              | $6000  |
| Medical expenses                | $5000  |
| Cash spending (ATM withdrawals) | $4400  |
| Auto maintenance/Petrol         | $4000  |
| Recreation/Hobbies              | $3600  |</p>

<ul>
<li><p>[x] Have $200k liquidity by EOY 2017.</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Move $100k into ETF/passive-managed fund.
<em>Worry about short-term volatility has prevented me from investing
heavily outside of HISA</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[ ] Spend less than $100/mo dining out on average.
<em>Average was ~$300/mo. Still better than last year. Would have been much
better w/o Bennelong and travel</em></p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Place entire bonus in an ETF/passive-managed fund.
<em>See above worry RE: short-term volatility</em></p></li>
<li><p>[x] Save $5000/mo on average</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] $60k from income per year
<em>Not exactly $5000/mo, but extremely close (4.5k/mo)</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Professional Life</h3>

<ul>
<li>[x] Take a team leadership role by the end of the year</li>
<li>[ ] Write more C++ than Go or Python</li>
<li>[x] Be happy with work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hobbies and Doing Stuff</h2>

<h3>BJJ</h3>

<p>Coming back to BJJ is going to be hard, but already in only being 3 weeks
back, I&#39;ve remembered what the itch is again. This year is about setting
myself up for a blackbelt in ~2 years.</p>

<p>I am to be okay with not competing. The risk of injury isn&#39;t worth it.</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] Have a serious-injury free year.</li>
<li>[ ] Keep a training journal.</li>
<li>[ ] Train 3 times a week.
<em>Trained closer to 2 times a week. I don&#39;t think this is likely to change.
Work constraints, life constraints, and injury risk prevent doing this more
often.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Surfing</h3>

<p>Surfing is a great &quot;new&quot; hobby. The focus is on having fun, and enjoying it -
not on getting better.</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Surf 2 times a week (conditions permitting).</li>
<li>[x] Continue having fun.
<em>Sadly, not even close.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Swimming</h3>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Swim at least once a week

<ul>
<li>[ ] Start @ 1km</li>
<li>[ ] @1.5kms by July</li>
<li>[ ] @2kms by 2018
<em>Also, not even close.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Reading and Learning</h2>

<p>Heaps of downtime is spent doing useless crap. Curbing that crap is really
important. Books are one method of avoiding crap.</p>

<p>Last year, the book goal was a failure, though the distribution per-month got
much closer to 3 than 2015. This year&#39;s goal is the same as last year&#39;s.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>[x] Read more books.</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] 36 books (3 / mo.)
<em>Read 30 books (trailed off towards the end of the year).</em></li>
<li>[ ] 2 professional books
<em>Read 1 professional book</em></li>
<li>[ ] 10 non-fiction (not counting the above)
<em>Read 5 non-fiction books</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[x] Waste less time on fast food internet</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Stop reading reddit in the mornings before getting out of bed.
<em>Sadly still on it :-( Have stopped reading comments by blocking them
on my phone, though.</em></li>
<li>[x] Absolutely no:

<ul>
<li>[x] Politics</li>
<li>[x] Reading comments, but not article</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[ ] Get out more</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Go to museums 6 times
<em>Not even close. I think we went probably twice</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
