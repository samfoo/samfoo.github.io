        <h1>Memorable Quotes</h1>

<p>&quot;I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein&#39;s
brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and
died in cotton fields and sweatshops.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">- Stephen Jay Gould</div>

<p>&quot;Anyone whose goal is &#39;something higher&#39; must expect some day to suffer
vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? Then why do we feel it even when
the observation tower comes equipped with a sturdy handrail? No, vertigo is
somethin other than the fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness
below us which tempts and allures us, it is the desire to fall against
which, terrified, we defend ourselves.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">- Milan Kundera, <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></div>

<p>&quot;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a
hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a
wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act
alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a
computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization
is for insects.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">- Robert Heinlein, <em>Time Enough For Love</em></div>

<p>&quot;We want to be loved; failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing
that, hated and despised. At all costs we want to stir up some sort of feeling
in others. Our soul abhors a vacuum. At all costs it longs for contact.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">- Hjalmar Söderberg, <em>Doktor Glas</em></div>

<p>&quot;There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so
simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it
so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">– C.A.R. Hoare, <em>The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture</em></div>

<p>&quot;Oh, she says well, you&#39;re not a poor man. You know, why don&#39;t you go online
and buy a hundred envelopes and put them in the closet? And so I pretend not to
hear her. And go out to get an envelope because I&#39;m going to have a hell of a
good time in the process of buying one envelope. I meet a lot of people. And,
see some great looking babes. And a fire engine goes by. And I give them the
thumbs up. And, and ask a woman what kind of dog that is. And, and I don&#39;t
know. The moral of the story is, is we&#39;re here on Earth to fart around. And, of
course, the computers will do us out of that. And, what the computer people
don&#39;t realize, or they don&#39;t care, is we&#39;re dancing animals. You know, we love
to move around. And, we&#39;re not supposed to dance at all anymore.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">– Kurt Vonnegut</div>

<p>&quot;War is always about betrayal, betrayal of the young by the old, of idealists
by cynics and of troops by politicians.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">– Chris Hedges, <em>A Culture of Atrocity</em></div>

<p>&quot;I love him who does not hold back one drop of spirit for himself, but wants to
be entirely the spirit of his virtue: thus he strides over the bridge as
spirit.</p>

<p>I love him who makes his virtue his addiction and his catastrophe: for
his virtue’s sake he wants to live on and to live no longer.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">- Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em></div>

<p>&quot;In the 21st century, censorship doesn&#39;t work by withholding information.
Censorship now works by flooding with information, by causing distraction, by
causing confusion, by creating doubts and just this question mark and shadow so
that you really can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s going on.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">- Zeynep Tufekci</div>

<p>&quot;In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under
bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.&quot;</p>

<div class="attrib">- Anatole France</div>
