<h3>Ideas</h3>

<ul>
<li>[x] Surfing
<em>Been surfing consistently all year (barring surgery times). Have
gotten heaps better. This is definitely a success.</em></li>
<li>[x] Drawing
<em>First half of the year I was very consistent, and then tailed off. I
think I need to get back into it.</em></li>
<li>[ ] Painting
<em>Started out with a big job, never finished</em></li>
<li>[ ] Creative writing
<em>Did nothing</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Improve existing hobbies</p>

<li>[ ] Climb at least Ewbank 25 outdoors, sport
<em>Have effectively quit climbing due to breaking my leg</em></li>
<li>[x] Exercise 2-3 time per week
<em>Did really well while not in the &quot;surgery zone&quot;. Both surfing and
swimming were happening at least 2 times a week all year.</em></li>
<li>[x] 4WD trip with only ZoÃ« 4 times this year
<em>The Fraser trip knocked this one out of the park.</em></li>
<li>[ ] Improve cooking repertoire

<p>Finished 31 books (exceeding the goal of 24) in 2015. For 2016 continue
to improve:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] 36 books (3 / mo.)
<em>Only finished 28 (2.33 / mo.). I think this goal was frustrated
again by &quot;fast food internet&quot;. I&#39;m really not sure how to overcome
that.</em></li>
<li>[ ] 5 professional books
<em>Not even close :-(</em></li>
<li>[ ] 15 non-fiction (not counting the above)
<em>Not even close :-(</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[ ] Waste less time on fast food internet</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Stop reading reddit in the mornings before getting out of bed.</li>
<li>[ ] Casual internet reading should be Wikipedia, perhaps installing an
app would help?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[ ] Go live</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] At least 1 small music gig</li>
<li>[ ] At least 2 plays / theatre productions</li>
<li>[ ] At least 1 festival of some kind</li>

<ul>
<li>[ ] By the end of the year, the canyoning community in Sydney should be
looking to canyons.io for all trip reports and canyon guides.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>While this didn&#39;t work for canyons.io, it was relatively successful
  for liveheats.com. Heaps of time and effort led to it being one of the
  leading surf organisation tools.</em></p></li>

they are.</strong></p>
