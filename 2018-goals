<h1>Goals for 2018</h1>

<h2>Relationships</h2>

<ul>
<li>[x] Spend more quality time with ZoÃ«. I&#39;ve been heads down focused on
finances and commitments to others. Our relationship has suffered because of
that.
<em>Our relationship is better than ever. We&#39;ve gone out of our way to spend
more quality time just one on one</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Health</h2>

<p>Focus more on mental health. By the end of the year I should be able to say:</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy.</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p>[x] Continue not drinking.</p>

<p>This has been an smashing success. I continue to feel healthier and
happier. I now identify as a teatotaller.</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Do some kind of art activity at least once a fortnight. Take classes at a
community centre or TAFE if necessary.</p>

<p>Sadly, art has once again been a failure from a goal point of view. I did
do <em>some</em> artwork, but not nearly fortnightly.</p></li>
<li><p>[x] Build genuine relationships in Australia with people.</p>

<p>Having relationships outside of work has improved by continually pushing
D&amp;D and board games. There is still room for improvement on this front.</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Go swimming at lunch twice a week.</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Start @ 1km</li>
<li>[ ] @1.5kms by July</li>
<li>[ ] @2kms by 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t think I swam a single lap in 2018.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Finances</h2>

<p>At the end of 2018, we should be starting to look seriously for a house to buy
in the Sydney area, or accepting we&#39;re not going to buy here and starting to do
some kind of active looking elsewhere. This means continuing to reduce costs,
not making any serious purchases, and keeping down dining costs.</p>

<pre><code>We have actually purchasd a house!
</code></pre>

<h3>Finances</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>[x] Save &gt;= $60k pre-bonus.</p>

<p>Done.</p></li>
<li><p>[x] Save ~$100k bonus.</p>

<p>More than done.</p></li>
<li><p>[x] Put $10k into some high-risk investment.</p>

<p>Done. $10k still in Agent Cogo.</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Rebalance investment portfolio more scientifically. Invest more.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really do this, but I&#39;m happy with the outcomes above and not
worried about it. Investing more wasn&#39;t the right strategy for the last
year.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Professional</h3>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Get promoted to DEV4 This year.</li>
<li><p>[x] Be happy with my work/life balance.</p>

<p>I am very happy about my work/life balance.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<h3>BJJ</h3>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Train 3 times a week.</li>
<li>[x] Stay injury free.</li>
<li><p>[x] Get black belt.</p>

<p>I got a black belt!</p></li>
</ul>

<img src="/images/blackbelt-3-9d37310b.jpg" alt="blackbelt 3" /></p>

<h3>Camping / Outdoors</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>[x] Go camping, or travel out of the city at least once a month.</p>

<ul>
<li>Surf trips to Culbarra.</li>
<li>Camping/hiking trips to the mountains.</li>
<li>Canyoning.</li>
<li>4WD&#39;ing for the weekend.</li>
<li>Fishing trips.</li>
</ul>

<p>While we&#39;ve definitely done this at least once a month, I feel like we
haven&#39;t gotten out as much as we should have this year. House hunting and
saving really put a crimp in our weekend plans.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Art</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>[ ] Start drawing once a week.</p>

<p>No progress.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Board Games / Tabletop Games</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>[x] Play boardgames or D&amp;D socially at least once a fortnight.</p>

<p>Smashing success. Between the two groups, we have a regular rhythm going.</p></li>
</ul>
