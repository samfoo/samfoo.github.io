      summary: |
          A seasoned band of adventurers found their way to a remote inn after
          being accosted by bandits many times deep into the Sword Coast.

          After some much needed food, ale and milk, a colourfully dressed
          gypsey burst into the inn and approached the adventurers, speaking
          directly to them. He informed them that his master was in need of
          their service and presented them with a letter of invitation to the
          land of Barovia.

          After a long night's rest, the group agreed to heed the letter's
          instructions and headed down the old Svalich road towards Barovia.
          Eventually, strange mists engulfed them.  Nature warped around them.

          After being harried by a large group of direwolves, the group
          eventually arrived in the Village of Barovia just as night was
          falling. There they learned the land of Barovia is ruled by a cruel
          tyrant vampire lord named Strahd van Zarovich.

          Eventually they met Ismark, son of the burgermaster, and reluctantly
          agreed to help him and his sister Ireena who has been harrassed by
          Strahd for several weeks.

          As the group went with Ismark to his manor, they found Ireena. And
          they found Strahd. Strahd bites Ireena, leaving her incapacitated,
          and welcomes the group to Barovia. He then disappears, transmogrified
          into a swarm of bats.

          After stabilising Ireena and calming her and Ismark, the crew agrees
          to escort her to the town of Vallaki where Ismark believes she will
          be safe at St. Andal's church.

          The adventurers make their way from the Village of Barovia down the
          Svalich Road towards Vallaki. They come across Tser Pool, an
          encampment of Vistani. Amongst them is Madam Eva, a Vistana
          soothsayer who takes the fortune of each member of the party,
          revealing to them some more details of Strahd and hinting that there
          might be some items that can be used to destroy him and release the
          curse.

          After thanking the Vistani for their hospitality, the group continued
          up the Svalich Road. Eventually they arrived at a bridge crossing
          Tser Falls where they found Strahd himself.

          Immediately, [Thaddeus](#thaddeus) challenged him to a duel, which
          Strahd accepted. Eventually the paladin was killed, and Strahd once
          again, disappeared virtually unharmed.

          [Pip](#pip), taking [Thaddeus](#thaddeus)' horse galloped towards
          Vallaki as fast as he could. The rest of the group barely able to
          keep up.

          Finally the team arrived at the Blue Waters inn. [Pip](#pip) was
          inconsolible, and the rest of the party was shaken to their core.

      title: Ezmerelda
      summary: |
          Having been brought back to the Church of St. Andal, the adventurers
          found themselves udner the ire of the burgermaster for causing
          trouble in town with the vampire spawn. [Astrid](#astrid) had gone
          missing somehow in her escape from the coffin maker's shop.

          The burgermaster's henchman, Izek, approached them at the church, and
          told them they were to accompany him back to speak with the
          burgermaster, who would decide their fate. [Elf](#elf) made no secret
          of his hatred of Izek, but before it could come to blows, [Pip](#pip)
          talked him down.

          The crew accompanied Izek to the burgermaster where they were
          presented with an ultimatum; Deliver a strange vistana woman to him
          or be convicted of collaborating against the safety of the town and
          hanged in the town square.

          The team agreed to the ultimatum, despite [Elf's](#elf) apprehension
          about Izek. At the same time [Milivoj](#milivoj) declared his
          intention to accompany the team.

          After leaving the burgermaster's manse, the team made their way
          towards Van Richten's tower where they'd been told the vistana woman
          had last been seen. On arriving they found a wagon with a sign "Keep
          Out". Unable to resist, [Milivoj](#milivoj) opened the front door and
          triggered a trap exploding the entire cart and it's contents and
          leaving billowing black clouds of smoke floating into the air.

          After licking their wounds, the team made their way into the tower
          where they were able to command golems to control a lift to a room up
          top. After some experimentation they found, hidden behind an animated
          suite of armour, the Tome of Strahd. The book explained, in Strahd's
          own words, how he became a vampyr through a pact with Vol. His love
          for Tatyana, and how he killed his brother.

          It also described his fear of a sword of light, and the sun.

          Not long into their investigation, they heard a woman's voice cry
          "What the f&^*k" outside. Looking out they saw a woman and further in
          the distance a number of large wolves converging on the tower.

          Despite their guilt in the destruction of the wagon, the team were
          able to convince Ezmerelda of their good intentions, and besides; as
          the wolves converged now was not the time for bickering amongst the
          desperate.

          Together, the group fought with Ezmerelda and was able to kill or
          drive back the wolves and (it turns out) werewolves that were
          attacking. [Milivoj](#milivoj) and [Pip](#pip) learned quickly that
          the werewolves were immune to regular weapons, but vulnerable to
          magic and silver.

          After the defeat of the werewolves, the team was left to determine
          what they were to do with Ezmerelda and how they were going to deal
          with Izek and the burgermaster.

      title: Wizards of Wine
      summary: |
          After the defeat of the werewolves, and licking their wounds, the
          group had to decide on their next course of action. [Elf](#elf) left
          on his own to find out why the werewolves were working with Strahd.
          [Astrid](#astrid) was still missing, and the rest of the group feared
          the worst.

          They considered their options;

          First, they had found both their prophesised partner (Ezmerelda) and
          the Tome of Strahd. From the clues that they have, they believe
          another artifact can be found in the ruins of Berez.

          Second, they also knew that another artifact resides in a saint's
          house. Ezmerelda informed them that she'd been staying at the Abbey
          of Saint Markovia in the village of Krezk, which seemed to fit the
          description.

          Finally, they'd agreed with the Martikovs in Vallaki to investigate
          why the wine shipments had ceased.

          After some deliberations, they agreed that before seeking out further
          artifacts, they needed to gather supplies. If they wanted to get
          supplies, they'd need some kind of currency or favours, and resolving
          the winery problem seemed as good a plan as any.

          They also revealed to Ez how the mayor of Vallaki asked them to
          return her to him, but as they are not sympathetic to the mayor they
          chose not to do so.

          And so the two remaining members of the party, [Milivoj](#milivoj)
          and [Pip](#pip) set off with Ez to the Wizards of Wine Winery. After
          a long day on the road they began to approach the vinyards where they
          found several strange creatures beckoning.

          As they drew closer to investigate, they found it was Davian
          Martikov, the owner of the winery. He explained how the winery had
          been taken over by blights and druids five days prior.
          [Milivoj](#milivoj) and [Pip](#pip) agreed to investigate if they
          were remunerated in kinds.

          They drew close to the winery, but despite their uneasy feelings they
          saw no sign of druid or blight. Just as they began to enter the
          building however, from the vinyard they came.

          Hundreds of blights.

          As the battle raged, further blights and druids emerged from the
          winery building. The group held their own, but the odds were nearly
          insurmountable. The final remaining blights began to overtake them
          and both [Pip](#pip) and [Milivoj](#milivoj) fell. Ezmerelda standing
          alone was able to dispatch the final creatures and perform some basic
          first aide on the two fallen adventurers.

          Once again, they felt the weight of danger in Strahd's Barovia. They
          skulked into the stables of the winery where they were able to have a
          brief respite.

          After they'd recouped, the group began to investigate, door by door,
          the winery. Eventually they found another group of druids, but this
          time were prepared and dispatched them professionally before the
          perverted creatures could mount any resistance. Upon one of them
          [Milivoj](#milivoj) found a magical staff that could be used to
          destroy blights.

          Finally they were happy that the winery was secure, and they went to
          Davian Martikov. He paid them with silver ingots, and allowed them to
          rest at the winery as long as they needed. He also agreed to restart
          shipments to Urwin in Vallaki immediately, despite his hatred of his
          son.

          As they group discussed the winery with Davian further, he revealed
          that there were three magical gems which were planted in the fields
          which allowed the grapes to grow. Without them no further wine could
          be produced. One gem was lost when Urwin was on watch years ago.
          Another was lost when it was stolen by scarecrow creatures several
          weeks past. Davian believe this to be hidden in the ruins of Berez.

          The last gem had been stolen five days ago by the druids. He also
          believed this to be taken to their holy ground in Yester Hill not far
          from the vinyard.

      title: Next Steps
      summary: |
          After several weeks of rest and recuperation at the Winery as the
          guests of the Martikovs the adventurers again grew anxious. It had
          been some times since they'd heard from [Elf](#elf) and they feared
          the worst. [Astrid](#astrid) was still missing and they presumed dead
          or worse.

          Just as they were about to give up on waiting and continue their
          quest with only [Pip](#pip), [Milivoj](#milivoj) and
          [Ezmerelda](#ezmerelda) the group was greated by a nonplussed
          [Elf](#elf) returned from the hunt.

          He revealed that he'd discovered that the group of werewolves who
          attacked them at Von Richten's tower had a den in the hills to the
          west of Lake Baratok. He'd tracked them there and followed their
          movements for nearly a week. During that time he learned the there
          had been a political schism amongst the pack. Some amongst them were
          kidnapping local children, arming them and forcing them to fight to
          the death. The winner of several fights was deemed the strongest and
          infected with lycanthropy, thus ensuring the strenght of the pack.
          The leader of this faction was named Kiril. 

          The other faction was led by one named Emil. [Elf](#elf) didn't know
          the details of Emil's politics but knew that the key disagreement
          between the groups was the child fighting.

          Kiril disappeared one day and came back accompanied by dire wolves
          and others loyal to Strahd, and Emil was captured and taken to Castle
          Ravenloft.

          With that, [Elf](#elf) had fled, now understanding the gravity of the
          situation in which werewolves and vampires had aligned themselves.
          Several days later he had tracked the rest of the group to the winery
          and reunited.

          After some discussion [Pip](#pip) and [Milivoj](#milivoj) agreed that
          they couldn't allow child death matches. However, they also knew they
          couldn't face werewolves without silver weapons. And the only place
          to get any kind of weapons in Barovia is the Vistani.

          The group made their way to the Vistani camp outside of Vallaki. Here
          they agreed with the two leaders that in exchange for finding their
          daughter, who'd disappeared several days before, the vistani
          craftsmen would augment several arrows for [Elf](#elf) with silver,
          and replace the head of [Milivoj's](#milivoj) shovel with silver.

          [Elf](#elf) quickly found the trail of the lost girl and tracked her
          to the southern shore of Lake Zarovich. With keen eyes they spotted a
          figure in a boat several hundred metres out dumping a burlap sack
          overboard. They rushed and found it was the girl, and were only just
          able to save her from a terrifying death by drowning.

          The man who'd thrown her overboard was simple, though the group
          didn't wait for much explanation. [Pip](#pip) smashed through the
          man's boat and, being unable to swim, left him to die the same death
          he'd intended for the girl.

          After bringing her back, the group had earned the promised favour
          from the vistani, and were given the weapons they needed to defeat
          werewolves.

      title: The Werewolves
      summary: |
          After they'd secured their new weapons, the group followed
          [Elf](#elf) as he led them through to Barovian back woods to where
          the werewolve den lay. Hewn into the side of a mountain, the den was
          a large cave whose entrance formed the visage of a howling wolf.

          Cautiously they approached, taking their time and observing.
          [Elf](#elf) informed them that seven of the wolves had left and
          traveled far enough away that they could safely approach the den.

          Upon entering they found two sentries and immediately engaged them.
          The sentries raised the alarm in the cave and they were joined by
          four others.

          In the fray, [Ezmerelda](#ezmerelda) was bitten horribly and could
          feel the beginnings of the lycanthropis virus infecting her.

          Before they could stop them, one of the wolves made it to the
          entrance and howled loudly across the valley. [Elf](#elf) could sense
          the others coming.

          The group was in no position to face off against seven more of the
          beasts, especially not in the state that [Ez](#ezmerelda) was in.
          Instead they chose to flee. With the skillful survival acumen of
          [Elf](#elf) they were able to safely get away for a time.
          Unfortunately, there was nothing to be done for
          [Ezmerelda](#ezmerelda)'s condition unless they could find wolfsbane,
          which was rare in these part of the forest. The group was exhausted
          at this point and the danger of pushing further while tired or
          resting and moving with a clear head the next day weighed on them.

          They chose to setup camp for the night, and posted a watch. On the
          second watch deep into the night [Milivoj](#milivoj) heard something.
          He awoke [Pip](#pip) and roused [Elf](#elf) from his meditation. From
          the rustling they heard a loud howl of identification. Though they
          dispatched of this lone wolf before he could escape, the six others
          knew their position again and approached.

          The group stealed themselves for what they feared may be their final
          stand.
