      summary: |
          A seasoned band of adventurers found their way to a remote
          inn after being accosted by bandits many times deep into the
          Sword Coast.

          After some much needed food, ale and milk, a colourfully
          dressed gypsey burst into the inn and approached the
          adventurers, speaking directly to them. He informed them
          that his master was in need of their service and presented
          them with a letter of invitation to the land of Barovia.

          After a long night's rest, the group agreed to heed the
          letter's instructions and headed down the old Svalich road
          towards Barovia. Eventually, strange mists engulfed them.
          Nature warped around them.

          After being harried by a large group of direwolves, the
          group eventually arrived in the Village of Barovia just as
          night was falling. There they learned the land of Barovia is
          ruled by a cruel tyrant vampire lord named Strahd van
          Zarovich.

          Eventually they met Ismark, son of the burgermaster, and
          reluctantly agreed to help him and his sister Ireena who has
          been harrassed by Strahd for several weeks.

          As the group went with Ismark to his manor, they found
          Ireena. And they found Strahd. Strahd bites Ireena, leaving
          her incapacitated, and welcomes the group to Barovia. He
          then disappears, transmogrified into a swarm of bats.

          After stabilising Ireena and calming her and Ismark, the
          crew agrees to escort her to the town of Vallaki where
          Ismark believes she will be safe at St. Andal's church.

      summary: |
          The adventurers make their way from the Village of Barovia
          down the Svalich Road towards Vallaki. They come across Tser
          Pool, an encampment of Vistani. Amongst them is Madam Eva, a
          Vistana soothsayer who takes the fortune of each member of
          the party, revealing to them some more details of Strahd and
          hinting that there might be some items that can be used to
          destroy him and release the curse.

          After thanking the Vistani for their hospitality, the group
          continued up the Svalich Road. Eventually they arrived at a
          bridge crossing Tser Falls where they found Strahd himself.

          Immediately, [Thaddeus](#thaddeus) challenged him to a duel,
          which Strahd accepted. Eventually the paladin was killed,
          and Strahd once again, disappeared virtually unharmed.

          [Pip](#pip), taking [Thaddeus](#thaddeus)' horse galloped
          towards Vallaki as fast as he could. The rest of the group
          barely able to keep up.

          Finally the team arrived at the Blue Waters inn. [Pip](#pip)
          was inconsolible, and the rest of the party was shaken to
          their core.

      summary: |
          The team, having barely recovered from the passing of
          Thaddeus, starts to learn of the problems facing the town of
          Valaki.

          The burgermaster is insane and trying to force happiness on
          everyone, the church is not a safe haven they thought it
          would be for Ireena, since the bones of Saint Andal, which
          protected it have been stolen.

          They determine that the stolen bones are the highest
          priority, and through some clever sleuthing determine that
          they were taken by Milivoj, the groundskeeper, and sold to
          Henrich the coffin maker.

          They confront Henrich who admits to the crime, but in the
          process awaken a nest of vampire spawn. [Elf](#elf) and
          [Astrid](#astrid) are able to escape with the bones and
          return to the church, Pip and Mighty are not so lucky.
          Mighty is killed by vampire spawn, and Pip is saved only by
          the timely intervention of the town's guard.
