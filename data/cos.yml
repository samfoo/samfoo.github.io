      title: Instantiation
      summary: |
          A seasoned band of adventurers found their way to a remote inn after
          being accosted by bandits many times deep into the Sword Coast.

          After some much needed food, ale and milk, a colourfully dressed
          gypsey burst into the inn and approached the adventurers, speaking
          directly to them. He informed them that his master was in need of
          their service and presented them with a letter of invitation to the
          land of Barovia.

          After a long night's rest, the group agreed to heed the letter's
          instructions and headed down the old Svalich road towards Barovia.
          Eventually, strange mists engulfed them.  Nature warped around them.

          After being harried by a large group of direwolves, the group
          eventually arrived in the Village of Barovia just as night was
          falling. There they learned the land of Barovia is ruled by a cruel
          tyrant vampire lord named Strahd van Zarovich.

          Eventually they met Ismark, son of the burgermaster, and reluctantly
          agreed to help him and his sister Ireena who has been harrassed by
          Strahd for several weeks.

          As the group went with Ismark to his manor, they found Ireena. And
          they found Strahd. Strahd bites Ireena, leaving her incapacitated,
          and welcomes the group to Barovia. He then disappears, transmogrified
          into a swarm of bats.

          After stabilising Ireena and calming her and Ismark, the crew agrees
          to escort her to the town of Vallaki where Ismark believes she will
          be safe at St. Andal's church.

      summary: |
          The adventurers make their way from the Village of Barovia down the
          Svalich Road towards Vallaki. They come across Tser Pool, an
          encampment of Vistani. Amongst them is Madam Eva, a Vistana
          soothsayer who takes the fortune of each member of the party,
          revealing to them some more details of Strahd and hinting that there
          might be some items that can be used to destroy him and release the
          curse.

          After thanking the Vistani for their hospitality, the group continued
          up the Svalich Road. Eventually they arrived at a bridge crossing
          Tser Falls where they found Strahd himself.

          Immediately, [Thaddeus](#thaddeus) challenged him to a duel, which
          Strahd accepted. Eventually the paladin was killed, and Strahd once
          again, disappeared virtually unharmed.

          [Pip](#pip), taking [Thaddeus](#thaddeus)' horse galloped towards
          Vallaki as fast as he could. The rest of the group barely able to
          keep up.

          Finally the team arrived at the Blue Waters inn. [Pip](#pip) was
          inconsolible, and the rest of the party was shaken to their core.

          The team, having barely recovered from the passing of Thaddeus,
          starts to learn of the problems facing the town of Valaki.

          The burgermaster is insane and trying to force happiness on everyone,
          the church is not a safe haven they thought it would be for Ireena,
          since the bones of Saint Andal, which protected it have been stolen.

          They determine that the stolen bones are the highest priority, and
          through some clever sleuthing determine that they were taken by
          Milivoj, the groundskeeper, and sold to Henrich the coffin maker.

          They confront Henrich who admits to the crime, but in the process
          awaken a nest of vampire spawn. [Elf](#elf) and [Astrid](#astrid) are
          able to escape with the bones and return to the church, Pip and
          Mighty are not so lucky.  Mighty is killed by vampire spawn, and Pip
          is saved only by the timely intervention of the town's guard.

      title: Ezmerelda
      summary: |
          Having been brought back to the Church of St. Andal, the adventurers
          found themselves udner the ire of the burgermaster for causing
          trouble in town with the vampire spawn. [Astrid](#astrid) had gone
          missing somehow in her escape from the coffin maker's shop.

          The burgermaster's henchman, Izek, approached them at the church, and
          told them they were to accompany him back to speak with the
          burgermaster, who would decide their fate. [Elf](#elf) made no secret
          of his hatred of Izek, but before it could come to blows, [Pip](#pip)
          talked him down.

          The crew accompanied Izek to the burgermaster where they were
          presented with an ultimatum; Deliver a strange vistana woman to him
          or be convicted of collaborating against the safety of the town and
          hanged in the town square.

          The team agreed to the ultimatum, despite [Elf's](#elf) apprehension
          about Izek. At the same time [Milivoj](#milivoj) declared his
          intention to accompany the team.

          After leaving the burgermaster's manse, the team made their way
          towards Van Richten's tower where they'd been told the vistana woman
          had last been seen. On arriving they found a wagon with a sign "Keep
          Out". Unable to resist, [Milivoj](#milivoj) opened the front door and
          triggered a trap exploding the entire cart and it's contents and
          leaving billowing black clouds of smoke floating into the air.

          After licking their wounds, the team made their way into the tower
          where they were able to command golems to control a lift to a room up
          top. Finding evidence that someone had been staying there, they heard
          a woman's voice cry "What the f&^*k" outside. Looking out they saw a
          woman and further in the distance a number of large wolves converging
          on the tower.

          Despite their guilt in the destruction of the wagon, the team were
          able to convince Ezmerelda of their good intentions, and besides; as
          the wolves converged now was not the time for bickering amongst the
          desperate.

          Together, the group fought with Ezmerelda and was able to kill or
          drive back the wolves and (it turns out) werewolves that were
          attacking. [Milivoj](#milivoj) and [Pip](#pip) learned quickly that
          the werewolves were immune to regular weapons, but vulnerable to
          magic and silver.

          After the defeat of the werewolves, the team was left to determine
          what they were to do with Ezmerelda and how they were going to deal
          with Izek and the burgermaster.
