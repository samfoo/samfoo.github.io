      title: "Parallel Interlude: Mystery Dinner"
      summary: |
          In a parallel version of Delway, [Parallel-Dr.
          Phil](#parallel-dr-phil), [Lord Faro Blimby Nar-nar De'Radwo Slyn VII
          Esq.](#faro), and [Garth](#garth), find themselves the guest of Count
          Vorloft.

          After the celebratory feast, our adventurers awoke to a panicked
          guard corps. The Count's daughter, Amelia, had been kidnapped
          during the night. Thankfully, the party had slept in the guard
          barracks and so had an alibi above reproach. Knowing the party's
          reputation, the captain of the guard, Oscar, requested their
          assistance in the matter.

          After a brief investigation of the scene of the crime, strange
          scratch marks and a letter intimating that Amelia had been having a
          dalliance with a gentleman not of the court, the team decided to
          interview the suspects, who were guests at the dinner the night
          before.

          After some clever word play and magically enhanced persuasion, the
          crew was able to discover

          1. A commoner who'd killed a nobleman and was attempting to
          impersonate him in order to marry Amelia (subsequently arrested and
          sentenced to hard labour in the Gnome Underdark Mining Corporation's
          mines)
          2. A spy sent to discover the aforementioned commoner and bring him
          to justice.
          3. A secret wererat lover of Amelia, who had kidnapped her for a
          ritual to turn her into a wererat so that she would be able to be
          with him forever.

          After learning of what happened to Amelia, the team heading to the
          sewers to find and rescue her. Thanks to a well-timed Fireball, and a
          hasty retreat, they were able to exit the sewers and return to the
          keep with Amelia alive (barely), and their reputations intact.

      title: Missing Contact
      summary: |
          The P-Team, having arrived in the Crown City of Jewel, sought council
          from the contact given to them by Vanard von Wroth, one Sir Thomas of
          Rouge. Calling upon him in the royal palace, the P-Team discovered
          he's been missing for several days. A peculiar interaction with one
          of the royal staff, led [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) and [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)
          to investigate the palace further.

          Eventually the two were accosted by a shady gnome, referring only to
          himself as "[Mittens](#mittens)". [Mittens](#mittens) offered to
          introduce the team to his boss, who most assuredly knew more details
          of Sir Thomas' disappearance.

          After some negotiation, and a rather costly bribe,
          [Mittens](#mittens) led the two to the door five metres away, and
          introduced them to Lord Morcom Kester, spymaster for the throne.

          The team learned that Sir Thomas had been sent on a diplomatic
          mission to the undercity several days ago, and had not returned as
          expected. He was to speak with the King of the undercity deuregar,
          and to form an alliance with him against any possible Southern
          aggression.

          Additionally, the team learned that the castle staff whom had been
          acting peculiary had had his memory wiped by some unknown magic. This
          was of great concern to Lord Kester, but he refused to speak of it
          further.

          The P-Team agreed to have [Mittens](#mittens) guide them through the
          undercity to discover the fate of Sir Thomas and report back, or save
          him if necessary.

          The motley crew ventured into the undercity where they were quickly
          accosted by a group of bandits all named "Dan". The bandits were
          quickly dispatched with after they intimated their desire to use
          [Jimmy](#jimmy)'s gold pouch without his consent.

          Before trampling the last of the bandits, [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)
          learned of a secret passage in the hall they were in. He took point,
          leading the crew to a small campfire [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) found a
          stupendously obese man, and a rail thin man. Through arcane means of
          pursuasion he learned they too were named "Dan" and that the other
          "Dan's" were their friends.

          Unfortunately, Obese-Dan was not as taken by [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)'s
          charm as Skinny-Dan, and declared his intention to harm anyone in
          their lair not in the "Dan Gang".

          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) took this as his cue and initiated a
          prospectively-defensive first strike on Obese-Dan.

          The session ended mid-battle, with Obese-Dan transformed into a giant
          scorpion.

    - date: 2019-01-18
      title: Tribe Named "Dan"
      summary: |
          The P-Team continued their melee with Obese-Dan-cum-scorpion. [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) scored two critical hits on one turn, and was
          followed by [Salim](#salim) severing the tail of the beast as well as
          rending several of its legs.

          Returned to his repulsive druid form Obese-Dan, frightened for his
          life, took one final, desperate measure, and broke his own finger to
          activate a magical ring that transformed him into a swarm of rats.
          The rats scurried down a nearby hole, but were quickly followed and
          dispatched by [Jimmy](#jimmy).

          As the fat criminal turned to escape further down the hole, [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) jumped down, crushing his head and ending both the
          chase and the large man's life.

          As the team took stock of their surroundings, they found a tunnel
          filled with viscera, dead bodies and rent flesh. [Mittens](#mittens)
          and [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) quietly ventured ahead while the rest of the
          team regrouped. Both of them wary of what they'd walked into saw
          flitters of movement followed by a conspicuous silence. They returned
          to the group where a reinvigorated [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) decided he
          would move on ahead, extricating himself from the warnings (and grip)
          of [Su Yuan](#su-yuan), he immediately came face to face with a giant
          scaly dog-like creature.

          Thinking quickly [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) cast invisibility on himself
          and [Su Yuan](#su-yuan), and slipped past the creature, quickly
          starting to explore the rest of the passage.

          Meanwhile, [Jimmy](#jimmy) attempted to pursuade the creature, by
          using his druidic powers to speak with it that it didn't want
          anything to do with us. The creature was unmoved by the attempt at
          persuasion, and began attacking the remaining P-Team members in
          earnest.

          [Su-Yuan](#su-yuan) managed to slip past and stun the creature,
          allowing the others to slip past to the interior of the path as well.
          Seizing the opportunity, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) took one of the sticks
          of dynamite that he'd acquired for the assault on Count Vorlofts'
          keep, and was able to light it and place it on (or rather, in) the
          creature.

          Making a hasty retreat, the dynamite exploded, destroying the
          creature, injuring some of the team and collapsing their escape
          route. With no other option, they pushed forward to find [Dr.
          Phil](#dr-phil), and hopefully Sir Thomas or at least the King of the
          undercity deuregar.

          [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) continued far ahead, and found himself in a room
          with what appeared to be three pups of the giant dog-like creature
          the companions had run into earlier. Despite his best efforts, he
          managed to draw their attention and his only escape route was a tiny
          hole. He jumped in, and slid until it opened in the ceiling of a
          chamber, 60 feet up. The fall knocked [Dr.  Phil](#dr-phil)
          unconscious, and left him in a dire situation, alone and with his
          only campanions not knowing where he'd gone.

          Just as he could feel the life leaving him, he was approached by a
          familiar presence. "It took you long enough", said [Dr.
          Phil](#dr-phil), and with this [Bill Bailey](#bill-bailey) found
          himself again in a dark chamber with one rotted exit and no idea how
          he got there...

          The rest of the P-Team came to the room [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) had gone
          down the hole in, but now it was empty. After some investigation and
          calling down the hole, they heard [Bill](#bill-bailey) respond.
          [Salim](#salim) and [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) lowered [Mittens](#mittens)
          down on a rope to see what he could do. As they were doing so, they
          were attacked by the monsterous dog-like pups.

          Dispatching of them, the team was eventually able to get
          [Bill](#bill-bailey) hauled up the the higher chamber. Backtracking
          briefly they found an iron gate with a rusted padlock, and made their
          way into a hallway not filled with half-eaten corpses. There they
          took a brief respite and ended the session.

      title: An Aboleth Named George
      summary: |
          The P-Team, after a short break discussed their options moving
          forward. [Bill Bailey](#bill-bailey), terrified of the dungeon
          refused to move forward until convinced by [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) that
          the only way to find [Julia](#julia) would be to delve deeper into
          the sewers.

          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) and [Bill Bailey](#bill-bailey) discussed the
          past of the young blacksmith's apprentice. Before he started having
          his episodes, he had gone out with friends and awoke in the middle of
          what appeared to be some kind of cult ritual. Cultists in purple
          robes, with their faces hidden were performing a blood sacrifice.
          [Bill](#bill-bailey) ran and escaped. He didn't know how long ago
          that was, nor did he know anything about how he got there. He just
          knew that he feels a warm sensation and a light and then wakes up in
          dangerous situations.

          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) described to him, his transformation to [Dr.
          Phil](#dr-phil), but the poor lad struggled to understand, and the
          P-Team could do little to explain the experience.

          Eventually, rested enough, the team ventured forward where they came
          across a grate in the ground with a milky white water underneath.
          Poking it, they revealed a gelatenous cube that immediately tried to
          consume them. After the defeat of the cube, and another brief rest,
          the team finally found a crossroads that [Mittens](#mittens)
          recognised and started to make their way much deeper underground.

          Leaving the sewers behind, they made their way to the beginning of
          the underdark, where they found a massive underground lake. The water
          completely still.

          [Mittens](#mittens) warned the group the be silent, and not to touch
          the water. Miraculously, and despite several temptations, the P-Team
          managed to heed his advice and made their way uneventfully across the
          lake in a magical raft that left the water undisturbed. Halfway
          across the lake, the team saw what they recognised as an Aboleth,
          which is the creature [Mittens](#mittens) was cautioning against
          disturbing.

          Finally, after disembarking on the other side of the lake, the team
          found their way to a campsite and was able to get a night's rest.

          In the morning they found [Bill](#bill-bailey) once again returned to
          [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil), who characteristically started his best effort
          to ruin any kind of subtlety or clandestine approach the team had
          planned.

      title: Sir Thomas
      summary: |
          With the return of [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) the group pushed further into
          the underdark. Eventually, their path opened to a massive underground
          chamber where they found themselves greeted by two Duergar guards.

          Thankfully [Jimmy](#jimmy) spoke Duergan and was able to communicate
          the groups desire to speak with the king. Despite this, a non-Duergar
          Dwarven ambassador was summoned to speak with the group in common. He
          explained to the group that they could not meet with the king
          directly, but that he could arrange a meeting with some other
          nobility or bureaucrat who would hear out their questions.

          The ambassador revealed that Sir Thomas had visited the city several
          weeks ago, and argued with the king before leaving.

          With this little information, the adventurers saw no other course
          than to allow themselves to be escorted by the guards to a spartan
          waiting room.

          [Jimmy](#jimmy) did his best to converse with the guard left to
          observe them, but had little luck. After a number of uncomfortable
          minutes, the guard excused himself and left the group alone.

          [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) grew anxious and started looking around. Soon
          realising that they weren't in a waiting room as much as a cell,
          though perhaps an unconventional one. The corridor was enclosed on
          either side by doors with a magical locks.

          Meanwhile [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) discovered another room similar to the
          one in which they'd been placed, and felt a slight draft coming from
          the floor stones.

          With [Salim](#salim)'s help, they pulled up a stone and revealed a
          bound and magically silenced Sir Thomas of Rouge. The P-Team unbound
          and dispelled the magic of the silence and finally were able to speak
          with the nobleman.

          Sir Thomas revealed he'd been speaking with the King of the Duergar
          about the threat of the southern kingdoms. The King was apathetic to
          the plight of those above ground, and despite Sir Thomas' efforts he
          was unable to convince him to form an alliance.

          With this failure, he turned to leave, and the next thing he
          remembered was awakening in this hovel, bound and magically gagged.

          With this, the team quickly resolved with Sir Thomas to quickly make
          egress from the underdark. Dispelling the magic of the locked doors,
          [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) looked out into the town to realise that the
          entire duergar militia was forming up to attack them.

          Sir Thomas assured the group that he would be able to create a path
          to the exit. The team burst into the courtyard.

          To their happy surprise, Sir Thomas revealed his true form &mdash; a
          adult bronze dragon. He held off the frontal assault while the P-Team
          was defended the rear.

          After dispatching of the first wave of attacking duergar, Sir Thomas
          and the team saw their chance and moved with haste towards the exit.
          As they neared the edge of town, however, their vision became clouded
          and dark tentacles appeared in a way halting their progress.
          Entangling Sir Thomas, the next wave of the duergar assault started
          to overwhelm him despite being in his dragon form.

          The team turned to see the King of the Duegar, dead eyed, emerge from
          the underground fortress. Behind him came a tentacle mouthed
          illithid.

          Before the illithid or the King could react, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan)
          reached into his bag of holding, pictured his last remaining magic
          bean in his mind's eye. As it materialised in his palm he threw it in
          the direction of the illithid.

          For a moment, nothing happened. Then the earth shook and a tiny
          pyramid appeared. The pyamid grew larger and larger, forcing the mind
          flayer and the king back into the fortress before settling
          unnaturally in the midst of the duergar city.  Towering over the rest
          of the structures and blocking any entrace or exit to the fortress.

          With this the tentacles disappeared. Sir Thomas threw off his
          attackers and explained that he recognised the magic of the pyramid.
          Inside the pyramid would be a mummy lord, a formiddible opponent even
          for the dragon himself.

          Upward through the underdark and to the sewers, past their own
          destructive path the team ventured back to the Crown City of Jewel.

          Returning from the underdark, exhausted and pushed to their limit,
          the P-Team was ready for a well earned break. They were granted
          rooms in the royal palace for the night and drifted into a deep
          slumber.

          Upon awakening, they approached Sir Thomas in his office where [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) gave a more detailed description of the risk a
          southern invasion would pose.

          He described his former life as personal general to the Emperor. Lu
          Kai was the vizier of the empire. He gathered support and led a coup
          against the Emperor, killing him and all his heirs before taking the
          throne for himself. [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) narrowly escaped with his
          life.

          The team also gave Sir Thomas details of strange happenings in the
          northern mountains that they'd uncovered. The agent smuggling weapons
          from the south to bandits in the north. The demonic possession of
          Count Vorloft in Delway. The appearance of Lu Kai in a dead soldier.

          Sir Thomas was left to ponder on this news, and suggested that the
          crew go to speak with the court wizard who was in need of adventurers
          to help with something that could be used against the Southern
          Imperial Army.

          So not to leave them thinking that he was not grateful for the
          service they'd provided in rescuing him; Sir Thomas also granted the
          team a country estate. Land, keep and servants.

          After discussing their options, the P-Team agreed that first they
          would speak with the count wizard, [Statlorf](#statlorf) before
          deciding on their next course of action.

          They made their way to the wizards keep, where he quickly enlisted
          them in a harebrained scheme to go back in time to discover the
          source of all magic in the kingdom.

          Despite their reservations, they eventually agreed (and were
          contractually bound) to have their consciousnesses sent back in time.

          Upon arriving they discovered a giant statue of a human bound in
          chains and locks. Immediately they were set upon by cultists, despite
          several attempts at diplomacy.

          They also found a strange hammer. Upon picking it up, it bound itself
          to the holder until one of the locks on the giant was smashed with
          it.

          The team slowly made their way up the giant, smashing lock after lock
          and being harried by cultists the entire time. Each lock seemed to
          bring more life and freedom back to the statue.

      title: Then End of Jim Dark Magic?
      summary: |
          As the crew continued up the statue they found a barracks in which
          they could have a short respite from combat. After a few moments of
          licking their wounds, the team continued up to the final chamber.

          There they found the leader of the cultists, and a horde of his
          followers. Despite this, the team heroically destroyed the final lock
          and defeated the remaining cultists.

          Upon this, the arcane power entrapping the giant statue was lifted
          and it was able to walk away. The team wasn't quite sure, by they
          thought they saw a brief sentiment of gratitude on his way.

          Soon they were yanked back to the present by the court wizard, who
          explained that this was not the source of all magic, but instead was
          a god, who the team rescued from captivity. After this, the Crown
          City of Jewel's past was rewritten. Instead of two major religions,
          there were three.

          The team was able to avoid having their past rewritten since the
          chamber used by the court wizard exists outside of time and space.

          The wizard, quickly reabsorbed in his research to try other
          coordinates for the source of all magic dismissed the P Team,
          thanking them (with a healthy amount of platinum for their work), and
          assuring them he'd call on them again should he find another
          potential source.

          As the group made their way back towards the castle they met a runner
          who informed them that Lord Morcom Kester was waiting for them south
          of the city. They also realised that a festival was afoot; a religous
          festival celebrating the freeing of a plain faced grey god from his
          chains. Legend has it that he was freed by an army of 100.

          Finally the team made their way to an inn, where [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)
          sweat talked the bouncers and they were able to get some well earned
          rest.

          Waking up in the early evening, the crew happily discovered that Jim
          Dark Magic was having his last show in the Crown City. Upon this news
          they knew they had to attend. After a long wait in line, they made
          their way into the circus tent.

          [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) and [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) made their way to the
          front of the crowd, which was held back by a magical barrier. Unable
          to resist the lure of Jim, [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) reached deep inside,
          finding inspiration in the visage of the cleverest wizard the world
          had ever known and dispelled the barrier.

          The crowd surged forward, screaming in ecstasy as they could get
          closer to Jim Dark Magic. Before any serious injury could befall
          them, Jim appeared from the ceiling and a wave of magic swept the
          crowd into a preternatural calm.

          All of the crowd save one; [Su Yuan](#su-yuan). Meditation and
          reflection on Jim Dark Magic had been plaguing the monk for many
          days. Despite his adoration, he felt something off. And this time,
          instead of being swept up in the charm of the magic, [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) found tranquility in his mind and remained aware.

          Jim, believing that everything was fine, sat down to read a book (his
          autobiography of course).

          Stealthily, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) crept behind the enchanter before
          striking, hitting a ki point specifically to disable the wizard for a
          few moments. Upon disabling him, the magic was dispelled from all who
          were present.

          Thinking quickly, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) addressed the crowd, telling
          them of the fraud of Jim Dark Magic. He bound Jim's hands and gagged
          his mouth. However, he would deliver him safely to justice.

          Word spread quickly through the town and soon there was a messenger
          from Vanard von Wroth asking that Jim be remanded into custody of the
          crown. After some assurances that he would be treated humanely and
          that he would not be released, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) relented.

          And with this, the crowd cheered "Monk! Monk! Monk!" (a rally
          curiously started by [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)). The team were liberators
          yet again.

          With this the team began preparations to head south to discover the
          motive behind the southern aggression, and to stop it before it could
          spread to the north.

      title: Steadly
      summary: |
          After the previous rest, the P-Team began to head south with a cart
          to meet Lord Kester. Soon upon leaving the crown city of Jewel they
          encountered the spymaster posing as a cabbage farmer.

          He informed the team of what he knew of the cities in the
          southernmost regions of the kingdom. There are two primary locations

          1. The elvish city of Ered Nuan. The elves have always been reluctant
          allies of other races, and Morcom had precious little intelligence
          from the cities of late.
          2. The dragonborn twin cities of Hedjet and Weset. There is some
          fracas amongst the royalty of the city. [Salim](#salim)'s family was
          connected to the power struggle, though he hadn't heard from them in
          some time either.

          After some brief deliberations, the team decided that it made the
          most sense to first attend to the dragonborn city. There,
          [Salim](#salim) could attend to his family and perhaps the team could
          gain some powerful noble allies.

          As the group decided, Lord Kester warned them that the crown had not
          heard from the main supply post on the road. He introduced the group
          to [Steadly "Danger" Carson](#steadly), a halfling mercenary who
          would be accompanying the team to investigate the supply post
          problem.

          And with that, the team embarked. After some time they came across a
          ruined carriage in the middle of the road. Cautiously [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) crept forward and discovered three ankhegs buried
          and waiting to ambush any passers by.

          Before they could formulate a sensible plan of attack, though,
          [Steadly](#steadly) fired several arrows into the ground, and the
          three creatures burst forth. Despite his eagerness and ruining of the
          element of surprise, [Steadly](#steadly) proved himself a powerful
          ally, and extremely capable with a long bow.

          After the ankhegs were disposed of, the team searched the cart that
          had been destroyed, but found no signs of either dead or surviving
          travelers. Nor did they find anything of value amongst the wreckage.

          Continuing on, the team finally arrived at the supply station. Clear
          cut on all sides for over a hundred feet, the group had no way of
          approaching stealthily. And since there was no obvious reason for
          concern they worked their way forward. Just as they reached the
          halfway point, five hobgoblin archers appeared and began to fire
          salvo after salvo at the team caught in the open field.

          Despite their tactical disadvantage, the crack archer skills of
          [Steadly](#steadly), and several giant carnivores [Jimmy](#jimmy)
          summoned from his bag of tricks gave [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) and
          [Salim](#salim) the cover they needed to close the distance and
          neutralise the archer threat.

          In the supply station they found the leader of the hobgoblins and
          were able to capture and interrogate him. He revealed that
          reenforcements were on their way and that they intended to occupy the
          supply station permanently.

          [Steadly](#steadly) was also able to find and free the previous
          civilian minders of the station, though the guards had been killed by
          the hobgoblins.

          Given what the hobgoblin leader had told them of the impending
          attack, the group began to formulate a defensive plan...

      title: The Hobgoblin Attack
      summary: |
          With their best laid plans ready, the team defeated the hobgoblins
          without incident.

          Despite their best efforts to interrogate the hobgoblin general, he
          revealed nothing of their motives other than greed and hate. No
          connection to the south.

          With his mission accomplished [Steadly](#steadly) made his way back
          to Morcom, while the rest of the team started to work their way
          towards the twin dragonborn cities of Hedjet and Weset.

    - date: 2019-06-07
      title: "Interlude: Refuge"
      summary: |
          The team finds themselves waking up to the voice of [High Vizier
          Statlorf](#statlorf) in their ears. He informs them that there's been
          a bit of an accident and he intended to send them to **garbled**, and
          that he's looking for a magical cup.

          Amongst them is an individual they do not recognise. He introduces
          himself as [Trist](#trist), a student of [Statlorf](#statlorf) and
          explains that he's as ignorant as the other as to how they arrived in
          such a place.

          Looking around they see they are next to a town. The town, and the
          P-Team are inside of a giant shimmering bubble. [Jimmy](#jimmy) goes
          up to the bubble and touches it. As he tries to push through it
          resists, but doesn't push back against him. Instead it feels like
          he's slowed.

          As they collect their thoughts and survey the rest of their surrounds
          the team is approached by a clay golem who enquires who they are and
          what they're doing. [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) introduces themselves.

          The clay golem introduces himself as Roswell, deputy to Sheriff
          Isaac, and asks how they managed to get through the barrier. It's
          been inpenetrable, protecting the village since the sacrifice of Jack
          and June - through their sacrifice the town is made safe.

          No amount of further inquiry is able to get more details about Jack
          and June, and Roswell insists that the team follow him to the
          sheriff's office to wait for Isaac to return.

          At the sheriff's office, the team finds one, occupied jail cell. The
          criminal is identified as a local miner who tried to blow up the
          temple to the west of town. When spoken to she's thoroughly crazy.

          After some further discussion there's a small earthquake. At the
          same time a commotion outside forces Roswell goes to investigate,
          demanding that the team stay put and wait. As they look out, the
          team sees several bandits in purple scarves squaring off against the
          massive golem. After a short staredown, they retreat away and are not
          pursued by Roswell.

          Before he can return to the office and speak further with the team,
          there's another commotion at the bank and a huge explosion. Customers
          and smoke come billowing out of the bank, and Roswell charges in.

          The team follows to see what is going on. Inside they find Roswell
          and a number of other bandits. The bandits have used some sort of
          explosive device to try to open the vault of the bank, but the
          explosion by itself wasn't enough.

          Just as Roswell starts to turn and discuss why they've left the
          station with the group, the town clock strikes twelve. There's an
          enormous earthquake &mdash; much bigger than the last and a giant
          fissure opens up and swallows the team where they die.

          ...

          ...

          ...

          They find themself in a white plane with a woman in front of them.
          She tells them they'll have to do better than that. And with a
          strange sensation...

          The team finds themselves waking up to the voice of [High Vizier
          Statlorf](#statlorf) in their ears. He informs them that there's been
          a bit of an accident and he intended to send them to **garbled**, and
          that he's looking for a magical cup.

          Quickly realising they're in some kind of temporal loop the team
          tries a number of other strategies. Each time resulting in their
          death, either by the apocolyptic earthquake, or through their own
          mistakes (often at the hand of Roswell).

          Finally after following clues, and listening to the prophecy of a
          witch named Poloma (who seemed to know they were in a loop), they
          find their way to the mine where Jack and June were lost. With some
          puzzle solving, they work their way into a giant room labeled "Shaft
          B" in the middle of which is a massive shaft.  After some
          consideration, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) leaps down the shaft and finds
          that it touches the bottom of the bubble surrounding/protecting the
          town. And outside the bubble is a massive purple worm, teeth the size
          of buildings. Whereupon the apocolypse happens again and they return
          once more to the garbled voice of Statlorf at the entrance of Refuge.
          Now with the understanding, at least, of what is causing the
          destruction.

    - date: 2019-06-20
      title: "Interlude: Leaving Refuge"
      summary: |
          After discovering that the final conflagration in each time loop was
          caused by a giant purple worm, the group set about discovering how to
          stop it.

          They made their way to Poloma the witch who told them that should
          would be able to give them a major prophecy, but that the ritual
          spell would require ten diamonds.

          Immediate plans for a bank robbery were drafted, and executed. Many
          diamonds were stolen. Bandits were vaporised. Banks were nearly
          leveled. Ten diamonds were procurred.

          The ritual began, and the witch uttered a single phrase; "look to the
          right".

          With that cryptic advice, disappointed, the team made their way to
          the fallen temple. They discovered it was a temple of the Goddess
          Istus lady of fate, destiny, divination and the future. Nearby they
          found a skeleton, still animated and alive who was once a priest to
          Istus.

          He Luca, and his brother Redmond, had been priests before the temple
          crumbled because of sick time. But he believed that the temple could
          be rebuilt if the adventurers could convince Redmond to assist him in
          a ritual prayer.

          And so they made their way to a stonefruit farm where they discovered
          Redmond was the leader of the bandits and what planning to rob the
          bank vault, believing that it held an artifact that could lower the
          bubble and free the town from it's entrapment.

          Now being expert bank robbers, the group offered their help. And so
          began another bank robbery, this time only slight less bungled. In
          the end however, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) was able to use his monk agility
          to get into the vault.

          There he discovered the diary of Sheriff Isaac, in which he
          chronicled his lust for a magical cup that Jack possessed. Finally
          Isaac could not resist the lure of the cup and murdered Jack by
          pushing him down Shaft B in the mines. The cup, however, fell into
          the hands of the nearby June, and around her &mdash; and the town
          &mdash; a bubble was errected, and the clay golem Roswell was
          summoned. June however, was incapacitated and stuck to the cup inside
          another, smaller bubble.

          Isaac described the shame and horror that he felt, and how he used
          the word "Junebug" as the command word for Roswell, directing him to
          protect the town of Refuge.

          Armed with this knowledge the team met another demise by way of
          apocolypse and once again woke in front of Refuge.

          This time, instead of negotiating or tricking Roswell, though, they
          simply took control of him. From there they rushed to Redmond who
          they convinced to help erect the Temple of Istus by promising him
          Roswell's control word.

          After the temple was mended, [Jimmy](#jimmy) communed with Istus who
          provided them with a magical lance, which can pierce time bubbles. It
          would not be able to pierce the larger bubble around the town without
          some additional force, but would allow them to enter Shaft A.

          So they ventured back to the mines and into Shaft A where they found
          Isaac and June &mdash; and of course, the cup. June was unconscious,
          inside the bubble with her hand resting on a magical chalice which
          [Salim](#salim) detected as being thoroughly evil. June also appeared
          to be the same woman as who had been appearing to the team upon each
          resurrection.

          After some initial talk, Isaac thought he had the upper hand and
          attempted to take the lance from them by force. He was immediately
          incapacitated by a number of fireballs from [Trist](#trist).

          Safely then [Jimmy](#jimmy) used the lance to burst the protective
          time bubble surrounding June and the cup. The cup, however was
          sentient to some degree. It spoke to each of the members, pulling
          their most painful memories from the past and promising the ability
          to go back in time and change them.

          The team was resolute. They wrapped the cup in a safe covering. At
          this moment, the final tremors began. June explained to the group
          that they could open Shaft A and close Shaft B and lure the worm away
          from the town.

          And so everyone got into a mining cart. They distracted the worm by
          having [Trist](#trist) throw fireballs at it to get its attention.

          Continuing down the shaft, the worm getting closer every minute.
          Finally they came to a junction with a path to the left and the
          right. Recalling the witches prophecy they chose the right path and
          were launched into the air out of the mine tumbling toward the larger
          bubble surrounding the whole town. Jimmy at the fore leveled the
          lance and their momentum pushed them just far enough through to pop
          the bubble.

          And with that they found themselves back in [Statlorf's](#statlorf)
          tower.

          After their return, [Statlorf](#statlorf) quickly evicted the team
          (without payment). Back to the City of Jewel. There they we soon
          greeted by a wizard student of the gnome who promised to transport
          them to their previous location. There was a catch. First they'd have
          to traverse a road in another realm, filled with strange encounters.

          On the road the team fought several battles. Banishing a hill giant.
          Freeing a gnome from being entrapped by in this ethereal plane.
          Finding the shadow of an old woman, long destroyed.

          Eventually they made it to the end, and found themselves back where
          they were on their way to the dragonborn twin cities.

      summary: |
          Finally having returned to their path towards the dragonborn twin
          cities, the group found themselves on the road nearing dusk.

          Rather than push forward through the night or camp in the forest,
          they found their way to the small village of Gravesford. Upon
          arriving at the local public house, the group found a large number of
          commonfolk patrons enjoying their drink.

          They found one in particular, a girl named Pinna, who was fascinated
          by the adventurers. She invited herself to the table and wanted to
          hear everything about them. Soon they learned that she was the local
          witch, performing the magic required by the townsfolk to keep simple
          life bearable.

          After some time discussing magic, and their varying abilities in it,
          the tavern was interrupted by the entry of a knight and his retinue.
          He proclaimed his title, Sir Pellington, and declared that there was
          a reward being offered by the new Baron for the head of a local orc
          chieftain for the murder of the last Baron and his family.

          Sir Pellington was quick to point out personally and in great detail
          to any of the &quot;pathetic peasant rabble&quote; that they needn't
          bother with the bounty as he would be the one to collect.

          Eyeing the adventurers he approached their table and challenged [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) to defy him in this. Never one to back down from a
          challenge, run from protecting the honour of the commonfolk, or miss
          a chance to lose embarrassingly in public, the monk stood up and
          suggested that they take the discussion outside.

          Sir Pellington, not being the sort to accommodate a rather reasonable
          request drew his sword and swung at [Su Yuan](#su-yuan). The two
          manoeuvered for several minutes, trading blows neither unable to find
          the upper hand. Eventually, Sir Pellington overstepped the line of
          honourable bar brawling by calling forth eldritch strength and
          blasting [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) with dark energy.

          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) responded in kind, blasting Pellington and
          several of his compatriots with the lightening stored in his ring.
          From here the brawl devolved quickly into a serious altercation.

          While the P-Team was unmatched and overpowered, they fought bravely.
          [Jimmy](#jimmy) summoning several creature from his bag of tricks,
          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) and [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) were frozen solid by a
          cold blast from Pellington, but [Salim](#salim) with his draconic
          lineage able to resist.

          Eventually several of Pellington's attendants were killed, and the
          P-Team was unconscious while the arrogant knight was forced to flee
          with his last remaining squire.

          Soon after, the group was revived from their swoons by Pinna and the
          innkeeper. Through the judicious use of bribery they were able to
          disuade the innkeeper from evicting them outright and eventually
          headed to their rooms to recover themselves.

          Several hours into the night they all awoke to the sounds of
          explosions. Assuming that it was Pellington again, [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) and the others raced to the source where they found
          instead the sacked house of their new friend Pinna, several dead
          orcish bodies, but no young witch.

          Looking into the distance they saw the raiding party glaring back at
          them carrying a figure.

      title: "The Orc Horde"
      summary: |
          The team decided to wait until morning before pursuing the orcs. At
          dawn they were awoken by a throng of townspeople preparing to make
          their way into the forest in order to exact vengence on the orcs.

          [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) and [Salim](#salim) convinced the townspeople to
          take up arms with the group and that together they would head into
          the forest and vanquish the evil orcish threat. Evenvtually as they
          reached the forest, the reality of the situation forced the
          townspeople to reconsider their engagement in the affair and
          ultimately it was left to the P-Team to pursue.

          Following the path of the orcs was not difficult until they arrived
          at a fork with a small contingent heading to the right and the larger
          group going left. After some debate, the group decided to go left.

          Soon after, [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) spotted a sentry's blind and loudly
          proclaimed it, to be immediately pincushioned by arrows.

          A truly embarassing combat for all involved followed, with the team
          eventually the victors. Despite their better judgement [Dr.
          Phil](#dr-phil) convinced the others that they should take a break in
          the orcish structure, and again they were beset by orcs only several
          minutes after settling down.

          After this, [Salim](#salim) recalled a potion of stealthiness that
          he'd purchased from the goblin vendor in Delway. Without considering
          the... versimilitude... of the goblin he quickly quaffed it and the
          group felt a quiet bubble surround them.

          They rested for a short period and then continued onward, this time
          staying off the main path and following through the forest. [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) in the lead signaled a sound and movement ahead, but
          the other two continued on and walked into a clearing with several
          more orcs disposing of bodies in a pit with a shambling mass.
          Another truly embarassing combat proceded, but resulted in a very
          full shambling mass.

          Finally, the group reached a clearing where they saw a large orcish
          fort, manned by hundreds of orcs. They attempted to hide, but both
          [Salim](#salim) and [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) were too slow, only [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) was able to conceal himself.

          An orc approached the two interlopers and demanded to know if they
          were from the village. Thinking fast, and going on the theory that
          the orcs were working for the Baron, [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) said as
          much. The orcs, as it happened did not take kindly to any of the
          Baron's men and closed in, ready to kill the two heroes. [Dr.
          Phil](#dr-phil) muttered a few works and opened a dimension door
          somewhere on the parapats of the fort and dragged [Salim](#salim)
          through.

          In the fort several orcs saw the heroes appear and the immediately
          turn invisible. They knew their opponents were somwehere in the fort.

          Throughout this, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) remained hidden on the edge of
          the forest.

      title: "Infiltration"
      summary: |
          [Salim](#salim) and [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) remained hidden and explored
          the fort until they found a broken down stairwell leading to an
          abandoned room. Here they rested, and communicated their status to
          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) and [Jimmy](#jimmy).

          The two adventurers on the outside were able to spot a potential
          opening into the fort, and [Jimmy](#jimmy) started to direct [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) there. Just as he was about to head down into the
          crack in the wall, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) saw something wholly
          unexpected. Their former colleague, [Steadly Carson](#steadly). After
          a hurried explanation about how he was here to collect the bounty on
          the orcs, the duo headed into the crack.

          At the end they found a hidden door, and after listening closely
          surmised that [Salim](#salim) and [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) were on the
          otherside. Summoning [Jimmy](#jimmy) and with the help of the
          dragonborne, they forced open the hidden door and were reunited.

          After a period of rest to recuperate from the battles with the orcs,
          the group began to steathily investigate the rest of the fort. They
          found strange shamanic orcs brewing some perfidious potion, groups of
          monster orcs larger than any they'd ever seen asleep in barracks,
          strange animated armours, and more.

          Having explored all but one room and still unable to find Pinna, the
          group was growing increasingly paranoid. They opened the final door,
          and immediately the orcs inside were aware of the presence of
          something.

          They struck quickly, and were able to quietely dispatch of the two
          orc hunters without them alerting the rest of the horde.
