      title: "Parallel Interlude: Mystery Dinner"
      summary: |
          In a parallel version of Delway, [Parallel-Dr.
          Phil](#parallel-dr-phil), [Lord Faro Blimby Nar-nar De'Radwo Slyn VII
          Esq.](#faro), and [Garth](#garth), find themselves the guest of Count
          Vorloft, having recently won acclaim ridding the region of bandits.

          After the celebratory feast, our adventurers awoke to a panicked
          guard corps. The Count's daughter, Amelia, had been kidnapped
          during the night. Thankfully, the party had slept in the guard
          barracks and so had an alibi above reproach. Knowing the party's
          reputation, the captain of the guard, Oscar, requests their
          assistance in the matter.

          After a brief investigation of the scene of the crime, strange
          scratch marks and a letter intimating that Amelia had been having
          a dalliance with a gentleman not of the court, the team decided
          first to interview the suspects, who were guests at the dinner the
          night before.

          After clever word play and magically enhanced persuasion, the crew
          was able to discover

          1. A commoner who'd killed a nobleman and was attempting to
          impersonate him in order to marry Amelia (subsequently arrested and
          sentenced to hard labour in the Gnome Underdark Mining Corporation's
          mines)
          2. A spy sent to out the commoner and bring him to justice.
          3. A secret wererat lover of Amelia, who had kidnapped her for a
          ritual to turn her into a wererat so that she would be able to be
          with him forever (*gaaaaaassssssspppp*)

          After learning of what happened to Amelia, the team heading to the
          sewers to find and rescue her. After a well-timed Fireball, and a
          hasty retreat, they were able to exit the sewers and return to the
          keep with Amelia alive (barely), and their reputations intact.

      title: Missing Contact
      summary: |
          The P-Team, having arrived in the Crown City of Jewel, sought council
          from the contact given to them by Vanard von Wroth, one Sir Thomas of
          Rouge. Calling upon him in the royal palace, the P-Team discovered
          he's been missing for several days. A peculiar interaction with one
          of the royal staff, led [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) and [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)
          to investigate the palace further.

          Eventually the two were accosted by a shady gnome, referring only to
          himself as "[Mittens](#mittens)". [Mittens](#mittens) offered to
          introduce the team to his boss, who most assuredly knew more details
          of Sir Thomas' disappearance.

          After some negotiation, and a blantant bribe, [Mittens](#mittens) led
          the two to the door 5 metres away, and introduced them to
          $SPYMASTERWHOSENAMEIFORGOT.

          The team learned that Sir Thomas had been sent on a diplomatic
          mission to the undercity several days ago, and had not returned as
          expected. He was to speak with the King of the undercity deuregar,
          and start to form an alliance with him against any possible Southern
          aggression.

          The P-Team agreed to have [Mittens](#mittens) guide them through the
          undercity to discover the fate of Sir Thomas and report back, or save
          him if necessary.

          The motley crew ventured into the undercity where they were quickly
          accosted by a group of bandits all named "Dan". The bandits were
          quickly dispatched with after they intimated their desire to use
          [Jimmy](#jimmy)'s gold pouch without his consent.

          Before trampling the last of the bandits, [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)
          learned of a secret passage in the hall they were in. He took point,
          leading the crew to a small campfire [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) found a
          stupendously obese man, and a rail thin man. Through arcane means of
          pursuasion he learned they too were named "Dan" and that the other
          "Dan's" were their friends.

          Unfortunately, Obese-Dan was not as taken by [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)'s
          charm as Skinny-Dan, and declared his intention to harm anyone in
          their lair not in the "Dan Gang".

          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) took this as his cue and initiated a
          prospectively-defensive first strike on Obese-Dan.

          The session ended mid-battle, with Obese-Dan transformed into a giant
          scorpion.
