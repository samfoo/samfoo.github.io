          A monk from the southern kingdoms. Before becoming a monk, he was
          some kind of military leader in one of the southern kingdoms. Liu Kai
          betrayed or attacked him which led to his exile and becoming a monk.
          Not much is know about Su Yuan's past, but he hunts Liu Kai
          relentlessly.

          Unable to pass up a chance to challenge another to a challenge of
          might, has a deep hatred and fear of the dark arts and especially
          necromancy, and unwilling to allow injustice to go uncontested, Su
          Yuan is often willing to charge in without thinking and is the first
          to put himself in front of danger.

          Annoyingly polite. Allegedly a &quot;flaming homosexual&quot;

      title: "Parallel Interlude: Mystery Dinner"
      summary: |
          In a parallel version of Delway, [Parallel-Dr.
          Phil](#parallel-dr-phil), [Lord Faro Blimby Nar-nar De'Radwo Slyn VII
          Esq.](#faro), and [Garth](#garth), find themselves the guest of Count
          Vorloft, having recently won acclaim ridding the region of bandits.

          After the celebratory feast, our adventurers awoke to a panicked
          guard corps. The Count's daughter, Amelia, had been kidnapped
          during the night. Thankfully, the party had slept in the guard
          barracks and so had an alibi above reproach. Knowing the party's
          reputation, the captain of the guard, Oscar, requests their
          assistance in the matter.

          After a brief investigation of the scene of the crime, strange
          scratch marks and a letter intimating that Amelia had been having
          a dalliance with a gentleman not of the court, the team decided
          first to interview the suspects, who were guests at the dinner the
          night before.

          After clever word play and magically enhanced persuasion, the crew
          was able to discover

          1. A commoner who'd killed a nobleman and was attempting to
          impersonate him in order to marry Amelia (subsequently arrested and
          sentenced to hard labour in the Gnome Underdark Mining Corporation's
          mines)
          2. A spy sent to out the commoner and bring him to justice.
          3. A secret wererat lover of Amelia, who had kidnapped her for a
          ritual to turn her into a wererat so that she would be able to be
          with him forever (*gaaaaaassssssspppp*)

          After learning of what happened to Amelia, the team heading to the
          sewers to find and rescue her. After a well-timed Fireball, and a
          hasty retreat, they were able to exit the sewers and return to the
          keep with Amelia alive (barely), and their reputations intact.

      title: Missing Contact
      summary: |
          The P-Team, having arrived in the Crown City of Jewel, sought council
          from the contact given to them by Vanard von Wroth, one Sir Thomas of
          Rouge. Calling upon him in the royal palace, the P-Team discovered
          he's been missing for several days. A peculiar interaction with one
          of the royal staff, led [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) and [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)
          to investigate the palace further.

          Eventually the two were accosted by a shady gnome, referring only to
          himself as "[Mittens](#mittens)". [Mittens](#mittens) offered to
          introduce the team to his boss, who most assuredly knew more details
          of Sir Thomas' disappearance.

          After some negotiation, and a blantant bribe, [Mittens](#mittens) led
          the two to the door 5 metres away, and introduced them to
          Lord Morcom Kester, spymaster for the throne, and purveyer of
          mysteries.

          The team learned that Sir Thomas had been sent on a diplomatic
          mission to the undercity several days ago, and had not returned as
          expected. He was to speak with the King of the undercity deuregar,
          and start to form an alliance with him against any possible Southern
          aggression.

          Additionally, the team learned that the castle staff whom had been
          acting peculiary had had his memory wiped by some unknown magic. This
          was of great concern to Lord Kester, but he refused to speak of it
          further.

          The P-Team agreed to have [Mittens](#mittens) guide them through the
          undercity to discover the fate of Sir Thomas and report back, or save
          him if necessary.

          The motley crew ventured into the undercity where they were quickly
          accosted by a group of bandits all named "Dan". The bandits were
          quickly dispatched with after they intimated their desire to use
          [Jimmy](#jimmy)'s gold pouch without his consent.

          Before trampling the last of the bandits, [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)
          learned of a secret passage in the hall they were in. He took point,
          leading the crew to a small campfire [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) found a
          stupendously obese man, and a rail thin man. Through arcane means of
          pursuasion he learned they too were named "Dan" and that the other
          "Dan's" were their friends.

          Unfortunately, Obese-Dan was not as taken by [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil)'s
          charm as Skinny-Dan, and declared his intention to harm anyone in
          their lair not in the "Dan Gang".

          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) took this as his cue and initiated a
          prospectively-defensive first strike on Obese-Dan.

          The session ended mid-battle, with Obese-Dan transformed into a giant
          scorpion.

    - date: 2019-01-18
      title: Tribe Named "Dan"
      summary: |
          The P-Team continued their melee with Obese-Dan-cum-scorpion. [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) scored two critical hits on one turn, and was
          followed by [Salim](#salim) severing the tail of the beast and
          rending several of its legs.

          Returned to his repulsive druid form, Obese-Dan was clearly
          frightened for his life. He took one final, desperate measure, and
          broke his own finger to activate a magical ring that transformed him
          into a swarm of rats. The rats scurried down a nearby hole, but were
          quickly followed and dispatched by [Jimmy](#jimmy) who was disgusted
          by rats.

          As the fat criminal turned to escape further down the hole, [Su
          Yuan](#su-yuan) jumped down, crushing his head and ending both the
          chase and the large man's life.

          As the team took stock of their surroundings, they found a tunnel
          filled with viscera, dead bodies and rent flesh. [Mittens](#mittens)
          and [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) quietly ventured ahead while the rest of the
          team regrouped. Both of them wary of what they'd walked into saw
          flitters of movement followed by a conspicuous silence. They returned
          to the group where a reinvigorated [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) decided he
          would move on ahead, extricating himself from the warnings (and grip)
          of [Su Yuan](#su-yuan), he immediately came face to face with a giant
          scaly dog-like creature.

          Thinking quickly [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) cast invisibility on himself
          and [Su Yuan](#su-yuan), and slipped past the creature, quickly
          starting to explore the rest of the passage.

          Meanwhile, [Jimmy](#jimmy) attempted to pursuade the creature, by
          using his druidic powers to speak with it that it didn't want
          anything to do with us. The creature was unmoved by the attempt at
          persuasion, and began attacking the remaining P-Team members in
          earnest.

          [Su-Yuan](#su-yuan) managed to slip past and stun the creature,
          allowing the others to slip past to the interior of the path as well.
          Seizing the opportunity, [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) took one of the sticks
          of dynamite that he'd acquired for the assault on Count Vorlofts'
          keep, and was able to light it and **ahem** place it on (or rather,
          in) the creature.

          Making a hasty retreat, the dynamite exploded, destroying the
          creature, injuring some of the team and collapsing their escape
          route. With no other option, they pushed forward to find [Dr.
          Phil](#dr-phil), and hopefully Sir Thomas or at least the King of the
          undercity deuregar.

          [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) continued far ahead, and found himself in a room
          with what appeared to be three pups of the giant dog-like creature
          the companions had run into earlier. Despite his best efforts, he
          managed to draw their attention and his only escape route was a tiny
          hole. He jumped in, and slid until it opened in the ceiling of a
          chamber, 60 feet up. The fall knocked [Dr.  Phil](#dr-phil)
          unconscious, and left him in a dire situation, alone and with his
          only campanions not knowing where he'd gone.

          Just as he could feel the life leaving him, he was approached by a
          familiar presence. "It took you long enough", said [Dr.
          Phil](#dr-phil), and with this [Bill Bailey](#bill-bailey) found
          himself again in a dark chamber with one rotted exit and no idea how
          he got there...

          The rest of the P-Team came to the room [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil) had gone
          down the hole in, but now it was empty. After some investigation and
          calling down the hole, they heard [Bill](#bill-bailey) respond.
          [Salim](#salim) and [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) lowered [Mittens](#mittens)
          down on a rope to see what he could do. As they were doing so, they
          were attacked by the monsterous dog-like pups.

          Dispatching of them, the team was eventually able to get
          [Bill](#bill-bailey) hauled up the the higher chamber. Backtracking
          briefly they found an iron gate with a rusted padlock, and made their
          way into a hallway not filled with half-eaten corpses. There they
          took a brief respite and ended the session.

      title: An Aboleth Named George
      summary: |
          The P-Team, after a short break discussed their options moving
          forward. [Bill Bailey](#bill-bailey), terrified of the dungeon
          refused to move forward until convinced by [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) that
          the only way to find [Julia](#julia) would be to delve deeper into
          the sewers.

          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) and [Bill Bailey](#bill-bailey) discussed the
          past of the young blacksmith's apprentice. Before he started having
          his episodes, he had gone out with friends and awoke in the middle of
          what appeared to be some kind of cult ritual. Cultists in purple
          robes, with their faces hidden were performing a blood sacrifice.
          [Bill](#bill-bailey) ran and escaped. He didn't know how long ago
          that was, nor did he know anything about how he got there. He just
          knew that he feels a warm sensation and a light and then wakes up in
          dangerous situations.

          [Su Yuan](#su-yuan) described to him, his transformation to [Dr.
          Phil](#dr-phil), but the poor lad struggled to understand, and the
          P-Team could do little to explain the experience.

          Eventually, rested enough, the team ventured forward where they came
          across a grate in the ground with a milky white water underneath.
          Poking it, they revealed a gelatenous cube that immediately tried to
          consume them. After the defeat of the cube, and another brief rest,
          the team finally found a crossroads that [Mittens](#mittens)
          recognised and started to make their way much deeper underground.

          Leaving the sewers behind, they made their way to the beginning of
          the underdark, where they found a massive underground lake. The water
          completely still.

          [Mittens](#mittens) warned the group the be silent, and not to touch
          the water. Miraculously, and despite several temptations, the P-Team
          managed to heed his advice and made their way uneventfully across the
          lake in a magical raft that left the water undisturbed. Halfway
          across the lake, the team saw what they recognised as an Aboleth,
          which is the creature [Mittens](#mittens) was cautioning against
          disturbing.

          Finally, after disembarking on the other side of the lake, the team
          found their way to a campsite and was able to get a night's rest.

          In the morning they found [Bill](#bill-bailey) once again returned to
          [Dr. Phil](#dr-phil), who characteristically started his best effort
          to ruin any kind of subtlety or clandestine approach the team had
          planned.
