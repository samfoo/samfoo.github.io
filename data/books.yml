      author: Jeff VanderMeer
      type: fiction
      review: |
                A disappointed end to a great trilogy. The mystery of Area X
                continued without any real answers that were forthcoming. At
                the same time, the character development stalled completely.

                By the end, not much had really happened. There were many more
                story threads than in the other two books, but only Saul's (the
                lighthouse keeper) resonated in any way, and then only a bit.

      title: Peripheral
      author: William Gibson

      review: |
                Very dense. Scott mentioned that he thought it was
                crazy-super-dense even for Gibson, but I thought Neuromancer
                was harder to get a grasp on. I really like the idea of the
                past being a communicable place that rich plutocrats from the
                future pillage. I thought the tech was mostly unimaginative,
                but maybe that's my cynicism.

                The “romance” between Flynn and Netherton was boring. Most of
                the characters were underdeveloped. The ending happened too
                abruptly (And then… everything worked out happily ever after!),
                and the mystery and motivations of the bad guys was completely
                undeveloped.

      review: |
                Brilliant new and riveting Holmes story. Nothing not to like
                other than it ended. I'm hopeful that Horwitz's other Holmes
                books are as good.

                The twist of how things connected at the end was unexpected,
                including the wife-cum-killer and the husband pedophile.
                Watson's internal narrative set the stage brilliantly. The only
                thing that could have been added was more of an insight into
                Holmes himself. But maybe that's the charm of the Sherlock
                stories?

      review: |
                Interesting take on the classic survival story. Mark Watney is
                a bit of a campy character. Too much “lol'ing”.  The survival
                bits are fascinating, and the maths is cool. However, it
                dragged on a bit longer than was necessary - and at every turn
                something going wrong was tiresome. None of the other
                characters were ever really explored (perhaps that was the
                point).

                Overall, it was a page turner. I finished it fast, unable to
                put it down.

      review: |
                Excellent twist, kept mostly hidden until the end (though at
                the point the reader is surely starting to guess).

                Moriarty himself describes Holmes as bumbling and childish
                never really a rival at all shattering quite a lot of the
                illusion.  Especially since... if he was really all that
                brilliant - How did Devoreaux start to take over across the
                pond to begin with?

                Overall, a good book but disappointing following on the heals
                of the first.  Here's hoping Horowitz makes a return to the
                Holmesian style in the next edition.

      author: Daniel James Brown
      type: nonfiction
      review: |
                Fantastic story. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. The
                era when sports meant heart and not dollars is sadly past. The
                back drop of the depression along with the coming tide of WWII
                cast against west coast blue collar workers was fantastic.

                It's hard not to be inspired by the story of Joe Rantz and the
                other boys. It's hard not to be jealous of the kind of
                comradery shown by the crew.

                Grippingly written. Not a book to be put down.

      review: |
                A psychological thriller throughout. The first half or so was
                extremely good, the explanation of the living planet and the
                confusion oozes through the pages.

                As the book procedes, though, it shifts its gaze increasingly
                towards its navel. Pontificating on all kinds of
                probably-philosophical-but-ultimately-boring existentialism.
                Should have powered through the final half, but found it
                extremely difficult. Not as clear a sci-fi statement on the
                real world as most classics.

      author: Markus Zusak
      type: fiction
      review: |
                Strong beginning, but wavers heavily towards the end. The
                message that “normal” people have the opportunity to be great,
                all they have to do is pay attention was paper thin. The
                romance coming together at the end was cheesy.

                However, being set in Sydney there was lots of interesting
                Australian-isms.  Zusak, just like in The Book Thief, wrote
                engagingly. I didn't really put the book down once I started,
                but felt unsatisfied at the end.

      author: Maria Semple
      type: fiction
      review: |
                Charming story, and a very interesting concept. Throughout the
                book the only character that I didn't think was a total jerk
                was Bee (the girl writing). Bernadette was a prima donna, too
                focused on herself and judgemental of others.  The dad, out of
                nowhere, went from foundation solid to off the rails crazy.

                All of the other women were catty and gossipy, complete
                stereotypes. Only once in the book did Bee finally recognise
                the privilege that she was born into.

                I loved the way the characters were explored, and the ending
                was about as good as it possibly could have been.

                Filled with irrational people and their problems. The way the
                story unfolded was well executed, but the “twist” felt forced.

                The characterisation of alcoholism was, I think, the best part
                of the book, and Rachel's character kept me the most engaged.
                Definitely an improbable amount of fucked-up people in such a
                small vicinity of one another, though. The epilogue felt as if
                the book had to have a happy ending.

                Pretty awesome. A self-aware novelisation (/s) of “The Last

                Ready Player One, was informal and funny.

                The 80's trivia/pop-culture was a bit much, this time around
                though. In Ready Player One it felt like it was taking a bit of
                the piss, but here it feels forced.

                What's to say here that hasn't already been written. ASOIAF is
                a fantasy epic, mostly readable series, and after spending a
                bunch more time understanding the lore and history of Westeros
                is even more interesting. The books start to slow as they get
                deeper into world building, but the eschewing of fantasy tropes
                keeps them engaging enough to continue.

                broader themes feel very much like the The Foundation series.

                The inner monologue of Justice of Toren made him the most
                sympathetic character in the book. So many of the other
                characters left me wondering about their motivations. Like a
                William Gibson novel, the depth of the vernacular left me
                confused for large portions "-" especially when talking

      review: |
                Typical Bill Bryson wit can't rescue a topic that is relatively
                devoid of factual information. The book can basically be
                summarized as "- We don't know much".

                I appreciate that the book did a good job of addressing some of
                the more pernicious of Shakespearean myths (he was multiple
                persons, he was Lord Byron, etc). Some of the history of London
                itself was interesting, and especially with respect to what I
                know about Elizabethan society, some time was spend not just on
                the court and the nobles, but on daily life.

                Overall, not a disappointment, but not the best of Bill's work.

      review: |
                A thought provoking foray into the pleasures and sorrows of the
                military. Fick, as an ivy-league liberal, is convinced by the
                ROTC recruiter to try a 10-week summer intro to the Marines
                (pre-September 11th). In this he gets the itch of comraderie
                and challenge.

                One quote from the recruiter, in response to a comment from a
                student about how having ROTC on campus went against the morals
                of the school (paraphrased) "- It's good that the ROTC is
                on campus because the university needs to liberalize the
                military"

                The middle of the book is largely a recounting of the 2002
                invasion of Iraq from the perspective of a ground soldier, and
                from a bloodthirsty American public. Ultimately I found this
                part of the book too procedural, and found my interest waning.

                As the book progresses towards the end, Fick becomes more and
                more conservative. By the end (once he's finished his 4-year
                stint) he's alienated his friends and family. They're unable to
                understand his perspective, and he theirs.

                The premise of digitised humans, where the limiting factor is
                cost, paints a world where only the rich can be both immortal
                and all powerful.

                The sex scenes were written for 14 year olds, and the hand to
                hand combat references to karate and other Japanesisms were

                to arrive at the distributed utopia created by a machine AI
                gone wild.

                Ultimately I felt that the augmented reality &amp; gamification

                The series as a whole was fun, and engaging enough, but

                Amazing! I've never been so engaged with a book about the

                transition from the classical world to the modern one is
                told in fascinating detail.

                Not only does Dolnick describe the how and why, but delves
                deeply into their relationships and interactions. Has there
                ever been a group so vain and so righteous in that vanity

                Interesting view from some Wall Street insiders about how
                technology has changed trading in the modern era.

                I was unimpressed with much of the description of technologists
                and their ethics, capabilities and responsibilities. Describing
                shipping proprietary code owned by your employer offsite
                against both criminal law and contractual obligations as
                something many Wall Street techies did can be viewed either as
                a gross misunderstanding or a depressing view into vocational
                ethics.

                The total lack of input from the side of HFT throughout the
                book is a bit deafening, especially since the deeper an
                understanding Brad Katsuyama and IEX get of HFT firms, the more
                they realise that the bigger banks are the ones enabling many
                of the more complicated trading strategies that favour HFT.
                Despite this, HFT remains the villain throughout.

                role it played in westward expansion and exploration. By the
                end, though, the book was dragging on and had gotten quite

      author: Asne Seierstad (Author), Sarah Death (Translator)
      type: nonfiction
      review: |
                A humanising look at one of the right-wing monsters of the
                post-9/11 era. Breivik's life is explored from beginning to
                end, engagingly written and darkly fascinating.

                One of the most interesting books of the year, to be sure. One
                of the most interesting things to take away from this is how
                little the extreme right's message has changed over the years -
                Women are objects, brown people are fine as long as they don't
                mix with whites or &quot; white culture &quot;, men should be
                men and other toxic masculinity tropes.

                I can't help but be left wondering how much impact the
                slaughter of so many soon-to-be politicos has had on Norway's
                future. Has Breivik's attack had a similar effect as Yitzhak
                Rabin's assassination did in Israel?

                Definitely one to recommend.

                While the convergent storylines were clever, and didn't feel

                banal and predictable. The post-apocolypse society wasn't
                fleshed out or particularly believable either.

                The rest of the novel was a bore. Rich people doing rich people

      type: nonfiction
      review: |
                Fascinating look at homicide in under-represented communities
                of South L.A. Frustratingly long winded at times, though the
                main story thread was gripping. One of the most thought
                provoking theses is that over-policing blacks (and other
                poor/minorities) for minor crimes, while simultaneously
                under-policing for serious crimes such as murder is partially
                what led to fear and hatred of the LAPD amongst these
                communities.

                The epilogue seemed divorced from the narrative of the rest of
                the book.  That is to say, murder rates are dropping
                precipitously in South L.A. even without drastic change in
                policy. This is ascribed to better social security and health
                care, but that seems too simple to me.

                At times, eye-rolling-ly contrived. The characters portrayed in

                represented. Much of the book felt like padding to get to

                As detailed and well written as most Krakauer, but lacking in

                post-9/11 and of the Bush administrations criminality.

                The way the army handled Tillman's death was, of course,
                literally criminal. However, I struggled to find meaning in
                searching out his real cause of death. After all, he was killed
                &mdash; like so many others &mdash; in an unjust war, in a
                foreign land, following orders he didn't believe in. No matter

                Clever, and funny. Fantastic writing. The phonentic spelling

                and constant switching of settings was hard to follow in an

                The underlying message of; &quot;hard work and perserverence
                are the biggest predictors of success&quot; is something that
                ultimately is difficult to argue with.

                The book fails to address the difference between extreme
                performers, do some of them really just outwork the others? The
                interlude about smarter, intentional practice, was particularly
                infuriating since the unstated premise is that knowing how to
                do so isn't a problem in its own right.

                Eventually, the number of anecdata and interviews with
                successful individuals becomes tiresome. The core take away was
                the goal setting approach that Duckworth advocates for &mdash;
                Maintain high-level goals and validate them with mid-level
                goals.

                Both the world building, and the science are expanded on just
                enough to give the world some mystery. The characters, by and
                large, make rational decisions and have really human problems.
                Can't wait to finish the rest of the series.

                Way too many rollercoasters throughout the book and not enough,
                proper, character development. In the second book of the
                series, Brown expands the scope of the battle to the solar
                system but the relationships between characters continues to
                defy reasoning.

                While Darrow's powers of invincibility in *Red Rising*
                bordered on parody, the double-double-double-double crossings
                going on throughout the story of *Golden Son* became tiresome.

                Solid ending to the series. Drawn out at the beginning, but
                eventually goes back to the style of the first book; action and
                plotting.

                The ending was &quot;bittersweet&quot; enough that the whole
                story didn't feel tied together with a bow. Definitely the best
                sci-fi I've read in awhile. Here's hoping for a television
                adaptation.
