      review: |
                Not nearly as good as the first two in the series. The mystery
                of Area X continued without any real answers that were
                forthcoming. At the same time, the character development
                stalled completely.

                At the end, I found not much had really happened. There were
                many more story threads than in the other two books, but only
                Saul's (the lighthouse keeper) resonated in any way, and then
                only for a bit.

      review: |
                Very dense. Scott mentioned that he thought it was
                crazy-super-dense even for Gibson, but I thought Neuromancer
                was harder to get a grasp on. I really like the idea of the
                past being a communicable place that rich plutocrats from the
                future pillage. I thought the tech was mostly unimaginative,
                but maybe that’s my cynicism.

                The “romance” between Flynn and Netherton was boring. Most of
                the characters were underdeveloped. The ending happened too
                abruptly (And then… everything worked out happily ever after!),
                and the mystery and motivations of the bad guys was completely
                undeveloped.

      review: |
                Brilliantly new and riveting Holmes story. Pretty much nothing
                not to like except that it ended. I’m hopeful that Horwitz’s
                other Holmes books are as good.

                Quite and interesting the twist of how things connected at the
                end was unexpected, including the wife-cum-killer and the
                husband pedophile. Watson’s internal narrative set the stage
                brilliantly. The only thing that could have been added was more
                of an insight into Holmes himself. But maybe that’s the charm
                of the Sherlock stories?

      review: |
                Interesting take on the classic survival story. Mark Watney is
                a bit of a campy character. Too much “lol’ing” and everything.
                The survival bits are fascinating, and lots of the maths is
                cool. However, the book dragged on a bit longer than was
                necessary - and every corner something going wrong was
                annoying. None of the other characters were ever really
                explored (perhaps that was the point).

                Overall, it was a page turner. I finished it ravenously fast,
                unable to put it down.

      author: Anthony Horowitz
      type: fiction
      review: |
                Not nearly as good as The House of Silk. Excellent twist, kept
                mostly hidden until the end (though at the point the reader is
                surely starting to guess).

                Moriarty himself describes Holmes as bumbling and childish
                never really a rival at all shattering quite a lot of the
                illusion.  Especially since… if he was really all that
                brilliant - How did Devoreaux start to take over across the
                pond to begin with?

                Overall, a good book but disappointing following on the heals
                of the first.  Here’s hoping Horowitz makes a return to the
                true Holmesian style in the next edition.

      author: Daniel James Brown
      type: nonfiction
      review: |
                Fantastic story. I couldn’t believe how riveted I was. The era
                when sports meant heart and not dollars is sadly past. The back
                drop of the depression along with the coming tide of WWII cast
                against west coast blue collar workers was fantastic.

                It’s hard not to be inspired by the story of Joe Rantz and the
                other boys. It’s hard not to be jealous of the kind of
                comradery shown by the crew.

                Grippingly written. Not a book to be put down.

      title: Solaris
      author: Stanisław Lem
      type: fiction
      review: |
                Very much a psychological thriller throughout. The first half
                or so was extremely good, the explanation of the living planet
                and the confusion oozes through the pages.

                As the book procedes, though, it directs its gaze firmly
                towards its navel.  Pontificating on all kinds of
                probably-philosophical-but-ultimately-boring existentialism.
                Should have powered through the final half, but found it
                extremely difficult. Not as clear a sci-fi statement on the
                real world as most classics.

      title: I Am the Messenger
      author: Markus Zusak
      type: fiction
      review: |
                Strong beginning, but wavers heavily towards the end. The
                message that “normal” people have the opportunity to be great,
                all they have to do is pay attention was paper thin. The
                romance coming together at the end was cheesy.

                However, being set in Sydney there was lots of interesting
                Australian-isms.  Zusak, just like in The Book Thief, wrote
                engagingly. I didn’t really put the book down once I started,
                but felt ultimately unsatisfied at the end.

      author: Maria Semple
      type: fiction
      review: |
                Charming story, and a very interesting concept. Throughout the
                book the only character that I didn’t think was a total jerk
                was Bee (the girl writing).  Bernadette was a prima donna, too
                focused on herself and judgemental of others.  The dad, out of
                nowhere, went from foundation solid to off the rails crazy.

                All of the other women were catty and gossipy, complete
                stereotypes. Only once in the book did Bee finally recognise
                the privilege that she was born into.

                I loved the way the characters were explored, and the ending
                was about as good as it possibly could have been.

      review: |
                A novel filled with irrational people and their intrigue. The
                way the story unfolded was incredibly well executed, but the
                “twist” felt forced. Extremely well written. After about the
                first 1/4, I couldn’t put it down.

                The characterisation of alcoholism was, I think, the best part
                of the book, and Rachel’s character kept me the most engaged.
                Definitely an improbable amount of fucked-up people in such a
                small vicinity of one another, though. The epilogue felt as if
                the book had to have a happy ending.

                Not as good as Ready Player One, but still pretty awesome.
                Basically a self-aware “last starfighter” with a it of star
                trek twist. The writing, as with Ready Player One, was
                impeccably informal and was totally a page turner.

                The 80’s trivia/pop-culture was a bit much, this time around
                though. In Ready Player One it felt like it was taking a bit of
                the piss, but this time around it feels forced.

                What’s to say here that hasn’t already been written. ASOIAF is
                a fantasy epic, mostly readable series, and after spending a
                bunch more time understanding the lore and history of Westeros
                is even more interesting. The books start to slow as they get
                deeper into world building, but the eschewing of fantasy tropes
                keeps them largely readable.

                broader themes feel very much like the The Foundation series.

                The inner monologue of Justice of Toren made him the most
                sympathetic character in the book. So many of the other
                characters left me wondering about their motivations. Like a
                William Gibson novel, the depth of the vernacular left me
                confused for large portions "-" especially when talking

      review: |
                Typical Bill Bryson wit can't rescue a topic that is relatively
                devoid of factual information. The book can basically be
                summarized as "- We don't know much".

                I appreciate that the book did a good job of addressing some of
                the more pernicious of Shakespearean myths (he was multiple
                persons, he was Lord Byron, etc). Some of the history of London
                itself was interesting, and especially with respect to what I
                know about Elizabethan society, some time was spend not just on
                the court and the nobles, but on daily life.

                Overall, not a disappointment, but not the best of Bill's work.

      review: |
                A thought provoking foray into the pleasures and sorrows of the
                military. Fick, as an ivy-league liberal, is convinced by the
                ROTC recruiter to try a 10-week summer intro to the Marines
                (pre-September 11th). In this he gets the itch of comraderie
                and challenge.

                One quote from the recruiter, in response to a comment from a
                student about how having ROTC on campus went against the morals
                of the school (paraphrased) "- It's good that the ROTC is
                on campus because the university needs to liberalize the
                military"

                The middle of the book is largely a recounting of the 2002
                invasion of Iraq from the perspective of a ground soldier, and
                from a bloodthirsty American public. Ultimately I found this
                part of the book too procedural, and found my interest waning.

                As the book progresses towards the end, Fick becomes more and
                more conservative. By the end (once he's finished his 4-year
                stint) he's alienated his friends and family. They're unable to
                understand his perspective, and he theirs.

                The premise of digitised humans, where the limiting factor is

                The sex scenes were written for 14 year olds, and the hand to

                told in fascinating detail.

                Not only does Dolnick describe the how and why, but delves

                against both criminal law and contractual obligations as
                something many Wall Street techies did can be viewed either as
                a gross misunderstanding or a depressing view into vocational
                ethics.

                The total lack of input from the side of HFT throughout the
                book is a bit deafening, especially since the deeper an
                understanding Brad Katsuyama and IEX get of HFT firms, the more
                they realise that the bigger banks are the ones enabling many
                of the more complicated trading strategies that favour HFT.
                Despite this, HFT remains the villain throughout.

      title: "Lesser Beasts: A Snout-to-Tail History of the Humble Pig"
      author: Mark Essig
      type: nonfiction
      review: |
                Some really interesting history about the pig, especially the
                role it played in westward expansion and exploration. By the
                end, though, the book was dragging on and had gotten quite
                repetitive.

      title: "One of Us: The Story of Anders Breivik and the Massacre in Norway"
      author: Asne Seierstad (Author), Sarah Death (Translator)
      type: nonfiction
      review: |
                A humanising look at one of the right-wing monsters of the
                post-9/11 era. Breivik's life is explored from beginning to
                end, engagingly written and darkly fascinating.

                One of the most interesting books of the year, to be sure. One
                of the most interesting things to take away from this is how
                little the extreme right's message has changed over the years -
                Women are objects, brown people are fine as long as they don't
                mix with whites or &quot; white culture &quot;, men should be
                men and other toxic masculinity tropes.

                I can't help but be left wondering how much impact the
                slaughter of so many soon-to-be politicos has had on Norway's
                future. Has Breivik's attack had a similar effect as Yitzhak
                Rabin's assassination did in Israel?

                Definitely one to recommend.

      title: "The Sellout: A Novel"
      author: Paul Beatty
      type: fiction
      review: |
                Less satire and more memoir than expected. The navel gazing was
                a bit much at times.

                The beginning set a brilliant tone, but the ending left
                something to be desired. Nevertheless, the best book on race
                that I've read in a long while.

      title: "Station Eleven"
      author: Emily St. John Mandel
      type: fiction
      review: |
                While the convergent storylines were clever, and didn't feel
                forced or unnatural as often happens, they also were ultimately
                banal and predictable. The post-apocolypse society wasn't
                fleshed out or particularly believable either.

                The rest of the novel was a bore. Rich people doing rich people
                things. Oh no.

      title: "Ghettoside: A True Story of Murder in America"
      author: Jill Leovy
      type: nonfiction
      review: |
                Fascinating look at homicide in under-represented communities
                of South L.A. Frustratingly long winded at times, though the
                main story thread was gripping. One of the most thought
                provoking theses is that over-policing blacks (and other
                poor/minorities) for minor crimes, while simultaneously
                under-policing for serious crimes such as murder is partially
                what led to fear and hatred of the LAPD amongst these
                communities.

                The epilogue seemed divorced from the narrative of the rest of
                the book.  That is to say, murder rates are dropping
                precipitously in South L.A. even without drastic change in
                policy. This is ascribed to better social security and health
                care, but that seems too simple to me.

      title: "Pirate Hunters: Treasure, Obsession, and the Search for a Legendary Pirate Ship"
      author: Robert Kurson
      type: nonfiction
      review: |
                At times, eye-rolling-ly contrived. The characters portrayed in
                the book are far too larger than life to be accurately
                represented. Much of the book felt like padding to get to
                page-count. The best bits were about the history of pirates,
                but they were few and far between.
