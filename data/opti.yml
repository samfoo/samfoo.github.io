      title: Escorting Cargo
      summary: |
          The group was commissioned by a dwarvish miner, [Gundren
          Rockseeker](#gundren) in Neverwinter to escort some mining equipment
          to a frontier town by the name of Phandelver. After several
          uneventful days on the road, they came across several dead horses in
          the middle of the road.

          They approached cautiously and found it was a trap layed by several
          nearby goblins. They truned the tables and ambushed the goblins,
          killing the foul beasts.

          Afterwards, some investigation revealed a path into the woods covered
          in goblin footprints. They decided to tie their horses and cart up
          and investigate the path.

          Soon they arrived at a cave that was guarded by several goblins.
          [Bob](#bob) was able to charm one of the goblins and convince him
          that they were friends. The team questioned the goblin and learned of
          a human prisoner being held in the cave, and a large bugbear named
          Klarg leading the goblin troupe.

          They decided to rescue the prisoner. [Keijo](#keijo) was sent in
          first to explore, and after passing some guard dogs tied up at the
          entrance found a passageway to what he believed was the cavern where
          the goblin described the prisoner being held. Being unable to see in
          the pitch black, he called out to the others who joined him.

          They made their way up a steep and tight passageway, eventually
          finding several sleeping goblins and a larger goblin cooking
          something foul over a fire. In the corner they spotted the prisoner.

          [Larry](#larry) used arcane power to communicate with the prisoner
          and let him know they were there to free him. [Keijo](#keijo)
          silently killed several goblins until he was seen and the rest of the
          group attacked at once.

          After defeating the goblins, they freed the prisoner who revealed his
          name was [Sildar](#sildar) and that was an associate of
          [Gundren's](#gundren). He revealed some more details about
          [Klarg](#klarg)...
