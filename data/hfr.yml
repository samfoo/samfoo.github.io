      title: Escorting Cargo
      summary: |
          The group was commissioned by a dwarvish miner, [Gundren
          Rockseeker](#gundren) in Neverwinter to escort some mining equipment
          to a frontier town by the name of Phandelen. After several
          uneventful days on the road, they came across several dead horses in
          the middle of the road.

          They approached cautiously and found it was a trap layed by several
          nearby goblins. They truned the tables and ambushed the goblins,
          killing the foul beasts.

          Afterwards, some investigation revealed a path into the woods covered
          in goblin footprints. They decided to tie their horses and cart up
          and investigate the path.

          Soon they arrived at a cave that was guarded by several goblins.
          [Bob](#bob) was able to charm one of the goblins and convince him
          that they were friends. The team questioned the goblin and learned of
          a human prisoner being held in the cave, and a large bugbear named
          Klarg leading the goblin troupe.

          They decided to rescue the prisoner. [Keijo](#keijo) was sent in
          first to explore, and after passing some guard dogs tied up at the
          entrance found a passageway to what he believed was the cavern where
          the goblin described the prisoner being held. Being unable to see in
          the pitch black, he called out to the others who joined him.

          They made their way up a steep and tight passageway, eventually
          finding several sleeping goblins and a larger goblin cooking
          something foul over a fire. In the corner they spotted the prisoner.

          [Larry](#larry) used arcane power to communicate with the prisoner
          and let him know they were there to free him. [Keijo](#keijo)
          silently killed several goblins until he was seen and the rest of the
          group attacked at once.

          After defeating the goblins, they freed the prisoner who revealed his
          name was [Sildar](#sildar) and that was an associate of
          [Gundren's](#gundren). He revealed some more details about
          [Klarg](#klarg)...

      title: Phandalen
      summary: |
          After rescuing Sildar, the group worked their way back to the main
          road and their wagons. Upon arriving back, they found a half orc
          gravely wounded resting against the wheel. Sildar immediately
          recognised him as [Orgrad](#orgrad) and explained to the raiders that
          he was one of the mercenaries hired by Gundren to travel with him and
          Sildar to Phandalen.

          Sildar explained that while he and Gundren were abducted, they
          weren't sure what had happened to Orgrad and had assumed he died.
          [Barry](#barry) stabilised the half orc and, confirming that he was
          able to walk, they began to head towards Phandalen.

          They arrived in the town without further incident and headed towards
          the local inn where Sildar promised to get them rooms. Exhausted at
          this point, they slept.

          Arising in the morning they found Sildar had already left on
          business. The raiders went out to replenish some supplies and see if
          they could find news of Gundren.

          They learned that no one had seen Gundren or his brothers for several
          weeks. The town locals were mostly preoccupied with the local
          ruffians who'd dubbed themselves the Redbrands. They were terrorising
          the shops and homes and generally causing problems.

          They met Sildar back in the inn where he paid them for their
          services, and told them that he would be preoccupied with looking for
          a wizard friend of his who had disappeared, last having been seen
          heading towards the manor which the Redbrands used as their
          headquarters.

          The raiders agreed to look for him, and were also interesting in
          seeing these ruffians for themselves. They worked their way towards
          the local pub known to be frequented by members of the gang. On
          arrival they were attacked, and defeated seven of the members.
          [Bob](#bob) was able to put two of them to sleep, and the group
          dragged them into the pub to question.

          After some enhanced interrogation, they found of that the Redbrands
          had a secret hideout underneath the manor, and also that they were
          somehow connected to the abduction of Gundren.
