        <h3>1. Parallel Interlude: Mystery Dinner</h2>
        <h4>2018-11-01</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>In a parallel version of Delway, <a href="#parallel-dr-phil">Parallel-Dr.
Phil</a>, <a href="#faro">Lord Faro Blimby Nar-nar De&#39;Radwo Slyn VII
Esq.</a>, and <a href="#garth">Garth</a>, find themselves the guest of Count
Vorloft.</p>

<p>After the celebratory feast, our adventurers awoke to a panicked
guard corps. The Count&#39;s daughter, Amelia, had been kidnapped
during the night. Thankfully, the party had slept in the guard
barracks and so had an alibi above reproach. Knowing the party&#39;s
reputation, the captain of the guard, Oscar, requested their
assistance in the matter.</p>

<p>After a brief investigation of the scene of the crime, strange
scratch marks and a letter intimating that Amelia had been having a
dalliance with a gentleman not of the court, the team decided to
interview the suspects, who were guests at the dinner the night
before.</p>

<p>After some clever word play and magically enhanced persuasion, the
crew was able to discover</p>

<ol>
<li>A commoner who&#39;d killed a nobleman and was attempting to
impersonate him in order to marry Amelia (subsequently arrested and
sentenced to hard labour in the Gnome Underdark Mining Corporation&#39;s
mines)</li>
<li>A spy sent to discover the aforementioned commoner and bring him
to justice.</li>
<li>A secret wererat lover of Amelia, who had kidnapped her for a
ritual to turn her into a wererat so that she would be able to be
with him forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>After learning of what happened to Amelia, the team heading to the
sewers to find and rescue her. Thanks to a well-timed Fireball, and a
hasty retreat, they were able to exit the sewers and return to the
keep with Amelia alive (barely), and their reputations intact.</p>

        <h3>2. Missing Contact</h2>
        <h4>2018-11-23</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The P-Team, having arrived in the Crown City of Jewel, sought council
from the contact given to them by Vanard von Wroth, one Sir Thomas of
Rouge. Calling upon him in the royal palace, the P-Team discovered
he&#39;s been missing for several days. A peculiar interaction with one
of the royal staff, led <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> and <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a>
to investigate the palace further.</p>

<p>Eventually the two were accosted by a shady gnome, referring only to
himself as &quot;<a href="#mittens">Mittens</a>&quot;. <a href="#mittens">Mittens</a> offered to
introduce the team to his boss, who most assuredly knew more details
of Sir Thomas&#39; disappearance.</p>

<p>After some negotiation, and a rather costly bribe,
<a href="#mittens">Mittens</a> led the two to the door five metres away, and
introduced them to Lord Morcom Kester, spymaster for the throne.</p>

<p>The team learned that Sir Thomas had been sent on a diplomatic
mission to the undercity several days ago, and had not returned as
expected. He was to speak with the King of the undercity deuregar,
and to form an alliance with him against any possible Southern
aggression.</p>

<p>Additionally, the team learned that the castle staff whom had been
acting peculiary had had his memory wiped by some unknown magic. This
was of great concern to Lord Kester, but he refused to speak of it
further.</p>

<p>The P-Team agreed to have <a href="#mittens">Mittens</a> guide them through the
undercity to discover the fate of Sir Thomas and report back, or save
him if necessary.</p>

<p>The motley crew ventured into the undercity where they were quickly
accosted by a group of bandits all named &quot;Dan&quot;. The bandits were
quickly dispatched with after they intimated their desire to use
<a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a>&#39;s gold pouch without his consent.</p>

<p>Before trampling the last of the bandits, <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a>
learned of a secret passage in the hall they were in. He took point,
leading the crew to a small campfire <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> found a
stupendously obese man, and a rail thin man. Through arcane means of
pursuasion he learned they too were named &quot;Dan&quot; and that the other
&quot;Dan&#39;s&quot; were their friends.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Obese-Dan was not as taken by <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a>&#39;s
charm as Skinny-Dan, and declared his intention to harm anyone in
their lair not in the &quot;Dan Gang&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> took this as his cue and initiated a
prospectively-defensive first strike on Obese-Dan.</p>

<p>The session ended mid-battle, with Obese-Dan transformed into a giant
scorpion.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="session" id="session-2">
        <h3>3. Tribe Named "Dan"</h2>
        <h4>2019-01-18</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The P-Team continued their melee with Obese-Dan-cum-scorpion. <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> scored two critical hits on one turn, and was
followed by <a href="#salim">Salim</a> severing the tail of the beast as well as
rending several of its legs.</p>

<p>Returned to his repulsive druid form Obese-Dan, frightened for his
life, took one final, desperate measure, and broke his own finger to
activate a magical ring that transformed him into a swarm of rats.
The rats scurried down a nearby hole, but were quickly followed and
dispatched by <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a>.</p>

<p>As the fat criminal turned to escape further down the hole, <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> jumped down, crushing his head and ending both the
chase and the large man&#39;s life.</p>

<p>As the team took stock of their surroundings, they found a tunnel
filled with viscera, dead bodies and rent flesh. <a href="#mittens">Mittens</a>
and <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> quietly ventured ahead while the rest of the
team regrouped. Both of them wary of what they&#39;d walked into saw
flitters of movement followed by a conspicuous silence. They returned
to the group where a reinvigorated <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> decided he
would move on ahead, extricating himself from the warnings (and grip)
of <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a>, he immediately came face to face with a giant
scaly dog-like creature.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> cast invisibility on himself
and <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a>, and slipped past the creature, quickly
starting to explore the rest of the passage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> attempted to pursuade the creature, by
using his druidic powers to speak with it that it didn&#39;t want
anything to do with us. The creature was unmoved by the attempt at
persuasion, and began attacking the remaining P-Team members in
earnest.</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su-Yuan</a> managed to slip past and stun the creature,
allowing the others to slip past to the interior of the path as well.
Seizing the opportunity, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> took one of the sticks
of dynamite that he&#39;d acquired for the assault on Count Vorlofts&#39;
keep, and was able to light it and place it on (or rather, in) the
creature.</p>

<p>Making a hasty retreat, the dynamite exploded, destroying the
creature, injuring some of the team and collapsing their escape
route. With no other option, they pushed forward to find <a href="#dr-phil">Dr.
Phil</a>, and hopefully Sir Thomas or at least the King of the
undercity deuregar.</p>

<p><a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> continued far ahead, and found himself in a room
with what appeared to be three pups of the giant dog-like creature
the companions had run into earlier. Despite his best efforts, he
managed to draw their attention and his only escape route was a tiny
hole. He jumped in, and slid until it opened in the ceiling of a
chamber, 60 feet up. The fall knocked <a href="#dr-phil">Dr.  Phil</a>
unconscious, and left him in a dire situation, alone and with his
only campanions not knowing where he&#39;d gone.</p>

<p>Just as he could feel the life leaving him, he was approached by a
familiar presence. &quot;It took you long enough&quot;, said <a href="#dr-phil">Dr.
Phil</a>, and with this <a href="#bill-bailey">Bill Bailey</a> found
himself again in a dark chamber with one rotted exit and no idea how
he got there...</p>

<p>The rest of the P-Team came to the room <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> had gone
down the hole in, but now it was empty. After some investigation and
calling down the hole, they heard <a href="#bill-bailey">Bill</a> respond.
<a href="#salim">Salim</a> and <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> lowered <a href="#mittens">Mittens</a>
down on a rope to see what he could do. As they were doing so, they
were attacked by the monsterous dog-like pups.</p>

<p>Dispatching of them, the team was eventually able to get
<a href="#bill-bailey">Bill</a> hauled up the the higher chamber. Backtracking
briefly they found an iron gate with a rusted padlock, and made their
way into a hallway not filled with half-eaten corpses. There they
took a brief respite and ended the session.</p>

        <h3>4. An Aboleth Named George</h2>
        <h4>2019-02-15</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The P-Team, after a short break discussed their options moving
forward. <a href="#bill-bailey">Bill Bailey</a>, terrified of the dungeon
refused to move forward until convinced by <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> that
the only way to find <a href="#julia">Julia</a> would be to delve deeper into
the sewers.</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> and <a href="#bill-bailey">Bill Bailey</a> discussed the
past of the young blacksmith&#39;s apprentice. Before he started having
his episodes, he had gone out with friends and awoke in the middle of
what appeared to be some kind of cult ritual. Cultists in purple
robes, with their faces hidden were performing a blood sacrifice.
<a href="#bill-bailey">Bill</a> ran and escaped. He didn&#39;t know how long ago
that was, nor did he know anything about how he got there. He just
knew that he feels a warm sensation and a light and then wakes up in
dangerous situations.</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> described to him, his transformation to <a href="#dr-phil">Dr.
Phil</a>, but the poor lad struggled to understand, and the
P-Team could do little to explain the experience.</p>

<p>Eventually, rested enough, the team ventured forward where they came
across a grate in the ground with a milky white water underneath.
Poking it, they revealed a gelatenous cube that immediately tried to
consume them. After the defeat of the cube, and another brief rest,
the team finally found a crossroads that <a href="#mittens">Mittens</a>
recognised and started to make their way much deeper underground.</p>

<p>Leaving the sewers behind, they made their way to the beginning of
the underdark, where they found a massive underground lake. The water
completely still.</p>

<p><a href="#mittens">Mittens</a> warned the group the be silent, and not to touch
the water. Miraculously, and despite several temptations, the P-Team
managed to heed his advice and made their way uneventfully across the
lake in a magical raft that left the water undisturbed. Halfway
across the lake, the team saw what they recognised as an Aboleth,
which is the creature <a href="#mittens">Mittens</a> was cautioning against
disturbing.</p>

<p>Finally, after disembarking on the other side of the lake, the team
found their way to a campsite and was able to get a night&#39;s rest.</p>

<p>In the morning they found <a href="#bill-bailey">Bill</a> once again returned to
<a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a>, who characteristically started his best effort
to ruin any kind of subtlety or clandestine approach the team had
planned.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="session" id="session-4">
        <h3>5. Sir Thomas</h2>
        <h4>2019-02-28</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>With the return of <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> the group pushed further into
the underdark. Eventually, their path opened to a massive underground
chamber where they found themselves greeted by two Duergar guards.</p>

<p>Thankfully <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> spoke Duergan and was able to communicate
the groups desire to speak with the king. Despite this, a non-Duergar
Dwarven ambassador was summoned to speak with the group in common. He
explained to the group that they could not meet with the king
directly, but that he could arrange a meeting with some other
nobility or bureaucrat who would hear out their questions.</p>

<p>The ambassador revealed that Sir Thomas had visited the city several
weeks ago, and argued with the king before leaving.</p>

<p>With this little information, the adventurers saw no other course
than to allow themselves to be escorted by the guards to a spartan
waiting room.</p>

<p><a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> did his best to converse with the guard left to
observe them, but had little luck. After a number of uncomfortable
minutes, the guard excused himself and left the group alone.</p>

<p><a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> grew anxious and started looking around. Soon
realising that they weren&#39;t in a waiting room as much as a cell,
though perhaps an unconventional one. The corridor was enclosed on
either side by doors with a magical locks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> discovered another room similar to the
one in which they&#39;d been placed, and felt a slight draft coming from
the floor stones.</p>

<p>With <a href="#salim">Salim</a>&#39;s help, they pulled up a stone and revealed a
bound and magically silenced Sir Thomas of Rouge. The P-Team unbound
and dispelled the magic of the silence and finally were able to speak
with the nobleman.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas revealed he&#39;d been speaking with the King of the Duergar
about the threat of the southern kingdoms. The King was apathetic to
the plight of those above ground, and despite Sir Thomas&#39; efforts he
was unable to convince him to form an alliance.</p>

<p>With this failure, he turned to leave, and the next thing he
remembered was awakening in this hovel, bound and magically gagged.</p>

<p>With this, the team quickly resolved with Sir Thomas to quickly make
egress from the underdark. Dispelling the magic of the locked doors,
<a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> looked out into the town to realise that the
entire duergar militia was forming up to attack them.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas assured the group that he would be able to create a path
to the exit. The team burst into the courtyard.</p>

<p>To their happy surprise, Sir Thomas revealed his true form &mdash; a
adult bronze dragon. He held off the frontal assault while the P-Team
was defended the rear.</p>

<p>After dispatching of the first wave of attacking duergar, Sir Thomas
and the team saw their chance and moved with haste towards the exit.
As they neared the edge of town, however, their vision became clouded
and dark tentacles appeared in a way halting their progress.
Entangling Sir Thomas, the next wave of the duergar assault started
to overwhelm him despite being in his dragon form.</p>

<p>The team turned to see the King of the Duegar, dead eyed, emerge from
the underground fortress. Behind him came a tentacle mouthed
illithid.</p>

<p>Before the illithid or the King could react, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a>
reached into his bag of holding, pictured his last remaining magic
bean in his mind&#39;s eye. As it materialised in his palm he threw it in
the direction of the illithid.</p>

<p>For a moment, nothing happened. Then the earth shook and a tiny
pyramid appeared. The pyamid grew larger and larger, forcing the mind
flayer and the king back into the fortress before settling
unnaturally in the midst of the duergar city.  Towering over the rest
of the structures and blocking any entrace or exit to the fortress.</p>

<p>With this the tentacles disappeared. Sir Thomas threw off his
attackers and explained that he recognised the magic of the pyramid.
Inside the pyramid would be a mummy lord, a formiddible opponent even
for the dragon himself.</p>

<p>Upward through the underdark and to the sewers, past their own
destructive path the team ventured back to the Crown City of Jewel.</p>

        <h3>6. Where to Next...</h2>
        <h4>2019-03-21</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>Returning from the underdark, exhausted and pushed to their limit,
the P-Team was ready for a well earned break. They were granted
rooms in the royal palace for the night and drifted into a deep
slumber.</p>

<p>Upon awakening, they approached Sir Thomas in his office where <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> gave a more detailed description of the risk a
southern invasion would pose.</p>

<p>He described his former life as personal general to the Emperor. Lu
Kai was the vizier of the empire. He gathered support and led a coup
against the Emperor, killing him and all his heirs before taking the
throne for himself. <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> narrowly escaped with his
life.</p>

<p>The team also gave Sir Thomas details of strange happenings in the
northern mountains that they&#39;d uncovered. The agent smuggling weapons
from the south to bandits in the north. The demonic possession of
Count Vorloft in Delway. The appearance of Lu Kai in a dead soldier.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas was left to ponder on this news, and suggested that the
crew go to speak with the court wizard who was in need of adventurers
to help with something that could be used against the Southern
Imperial Army.</p>

<p>So not to leave them thinking that he was not grateful for the
service they&#39;d provided in rescuing him; Sir Thomas also granted the
team a country estate. Land, keep and servants.</p>

<p>After discussing their options, the P-Team agreed that first they
would speak with the count wizard, <a href="#statlorf">Statlorf</a> before
deciding on their next course of action.</p>

<p>They made their way to the wizards keep, where he quickly enlisted
them in a harebrained scheme to go back in time to discover the
source of all magic in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Despite their reservations, they eventually agreed (and were
contractually bound) to have their consciousnesses sent back in time.</p>

<p>Upon arriving they discovered a giant statue of a human bound in
chains and locks. Immediately they were set upon by cultists, despite
several attempts at diplomacy.</p>

<p>They also found a strange hammer. Upon picking it up, it bound itself
to the holder until one of the locks on the giant was smashed with
it.</p>

<p>The team slowly made their way up the giant, smashing lock after lock
and being harried by cultists the entire time. Each lock seemed to
bring more life and freedom back to the statue.</p>

        <h3>7. Then End of Jim Dark Magic?</h2>
        <h4>2019-04-18</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>As the crew continued up the statue they found a barracks in which
they could have a short respite from combat. After a few moments of
licking their wounds, the team continued up to the final chamber.</p>

<p>There they found the leader of the cultists, and a horde of his
followers. Despite this, the team heroically destroyed the final lock
and defeated the remaining cultists.</p>

<p>Upon this, the arcane power entrapping the giant statue was lifted
and it was able to walk away. The team wasn&#39;t quite sure, by they
thought they saw a brief sentiment of gratitude on his way.</p>

<p>Soon they were yanked back to the present by the court wizard, who
explained that this was not the source of all magic, but instead was
a god, who the team rescued from captivity. After this, the Crown
City of Jewel&#39;s past was rewritten. Instead of two major religions,
there were three.</p>

<p>The team was able to avoid having their past rewritten since the
chamber used by the court wizard exists outside of time and space.</p>

<p>The wizard, quickly reabsorbed in his research to try other
coordinates for the source of all magic dismissed the P Team,
thanking them (with a healthy amount of platinum for their work), and
assuring them he&#39;d call on them again should he find another
potential source.</p>

<p>As the group made their way back towards the castle they met a runner
who informed them that Lord Morcom Kester was waiting for them south
of the city. They also realised that a festival was afoot; a religous
festival celebrating the freeing of a plain faced grey god from his
chains. Legend has it that he was freed by an army of 100.</p>

<p>Finally the team made their way to an inn, where <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a>
sweat talked the bouncers and they were able to get some well earned
rest.</p>

<p>Waking up in the early evening, the crew happily discovered that Jim
Dark Magic was having his last show in the Crown City. Upon this news
they knew they had to attend. After a long wait in line, they made
their way into the circus tent.</p>

<p><a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> and <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> made their way to the
front of the crowd, which was held back by a magical barrier. Unable
to resist the lure of Jim, <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> reached deep inside,
finding inspiration in the visage of the cleverest wizard the world
had ever known and dispelled the barrier.</p>

<p>The crowd surged forward, screaming in ecstasy as they could get
closer to Jim Dark Magic. Before any serious injury could befall
them, Jim appeared from the ceiling and a wave of magic swept the
crowd into a preternatural calm.</p>

<p>All of the crowd save one; <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a>. Meditation and
reflection on Jim Dark Magic had been plaguing the monk for many
days. Despite his adoration, he felt something off. And this time,
instead of being swept up in the charm of the magic, <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> found tranquility in his mind and remained aware.</p>

<p>Jim, believing that everything was fine, sat down to read a book (his
autobiography of course).</p>

<p>Stealthily, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> crept behind the enchanter before
striking, hitting a ki point specifically to disable the wizard for a
few moments. Upon disabling him, the magic was dispelled from all who
were present.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> addressed the crowd, telling
them of the fraud of Jim Dark Magic. He bound Jim&#39;s hands and gagged
his mouth. However, he would deliver him safely to justice.</p>

<p>Word spread quickly through the town and soon there was a messenger
from Vanard von Wroth asking that Jim be remanded into custody of the
crown. After some assurances that he would be treated humanely and
that he would not be released, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> relented.</p>

<p>And with this, the crowd cheered &quot;Monk! Monk! Monk!&quot; (a rally
curiously started by <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a>). The team were liberators
yet again.</p>

<p>With this the team began preparations to head south to discover the
motive behind the southern aggression, and to stop it before it could
spread to the north.</p>

        <h3>8. Steadly</h2>
        <h4>2019-04-28</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After the previous rest, the P-Team began to head south with a cart
to meet Lord Kester. Soon upon leaving the crown city of Jewel they
encountered the spymaster posing as a cabbage farmer.</p>

<p>He informed the team of what he knew of the cities in the
southernmost regions of the kingdom. There are two primary locations</p>

<ol>
<li>The elvish city of Ered Nuan. The elves have always been reluctant
allies of other races, and Morcom had precious little intelligence
from the cities of late.</li>
<li>The dragonborn twin cities of Hedjet and Weset. There is some
fracas amongst the royalty of the city. <a href="#salim">Salim</a>&#39;s family was
connected to the power struggle, though he hadn&#39;t heard from them in
some time either.</li>
</ol>

<p>After some brief deliberations, the team decided that it made the
most sense to first attend to the dragonborn city. There,
<a href="#salim">Salim</a> could attend to his family and perhaps the team could
gain some powerful noble allies.</p>

<p>As the group decided, Lord Kester warned them that the crown had not
heard from the main supply post on the road. He introduced the group
to <a href="#steadly">Steadly &quot;Danger&quot; Carson</a>, a halfling mercenary who
would be accompanying the team to investigate the supply post
problem.</p>

<p>And with that, the team embarked. After some time they came across a
ruined carriage in the middle of the road. Cautiously <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> crept forward and discovered three ankhegs buried
and waiting to ambush any passers by.</p>

<p>Before they could formulate a sensible plan of attack, though,
<a href="#steadly">Steadly</a> fired several arrows into the ground, and the
three creatures burst forth. Despite his eagerness and ruining of the
element of surprise, <a href="#steadly">Steadly</a> proved himself a powerful
ally, and extremely capable with a long bow.</p>

<p>After the ankhegs were disposed of, the team searched the cart that
had been destroyed, but found no signs of either dead or surviving
travelers. Nor did they find anything of value amongst the wreckage.</p>

<p>Continuing on, the team finally arrived at the supply station. Clear
cut on all sides for over a hundred feet, the group had no way of
approaching stealthily. And since there was no obvious reason for
concern they worked their way forward. Just as they reached the
halfway point, five hobgoblin archers appeared and began to fire
salvo after salvo at the team caught in the open field.</p>

<p>Despite their tactical disadvantage, the crack archer skills of
<a href="#steadly">Steadly</a>, and several giant carnivores <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a>
summoned from his bag of tricks gave <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> and
<a href="#salim">Salim</a> the cover they needed to close the distance and
neutralise the archer threat.</p>

<p>In the supply station they found the leader of the hobgoblins and
were able to capture and interrogate him. He revealed that
reenforcements were on their way and that they intended to occupy the
supply station permanently.</p>

<p><a href="#steadly">Steadly</a> was also able to find and free the previous
civilian minders of the station, though the guards had been killed by
the hobgoblins.</p>

<p>Given what the hobgoblin leader had told them of the impending
attack, the group began to formulate a defensive plan...</p>

        <h4>2019-06-07</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The team finds themselves waking up to the voice of <a href="#statlorf">High Vizier
Statlorf</a> in their ears. He informs them that there&#39;s been
a bit of an accident and he intended to send them to <strong>garbled</strong>, and
that he&#39;s looking for a magical cup.</p>

<p>Amongst them is an individual they do not recognise. He introduces
himself as <a href="#trist">Trist</a>, a student of <a href="#statlorf">Statlorf</a> and
explains that he&#39;s as ignorant as the other as to how they arrived in
such a place.</p>

<p>Looking around they see they are next to a town. The town, and the
P-Team are inside of a giant shimmering bubble. <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> goes
up to the bubble and touches it. As he tries to push through it
resists, but doesn&#39;t push back against him. Instead it feels like
he&#39;s slowed.</p>

<p>As they collect their thoughts and survey the rest of their surrounds
the team is approached by a clay golem who enquires who they are and
what they&#39;re doing. <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> introduces themselves.</p>

<p>The clay golem introduces himself as Roswell, deputy to Sheriff
Isaac, and asks how they managed to get through the barrier. It&#39;s
been inpenetrable, protecting the village since the sacrifice of Jack
and June - through their sacrifice the town is made safe.</p>

<p>No amount of further inquiry is able to get more details about Jack
and June, and Roswell insists that the team follow him to the
sheriff&#39;s office to wait for Isaac to return.</p>

<p>At the sheriff&#39;s office, the team finds one, occupied jail cell. The
criminal is identified as a local miner who tried to blow up the
temple to the west of town. When spoken to she&#39;s thoroughly crazy.</p>

<p>After some further discussion there&#39;s a small earthquake. At the
same time a commotion outside forces Roswell goes to investigate,
demanding that the team stay put and wait. As they look out, the
team sees several bandits in purple scarves squaring off against the
massive golem. After a short staredown, they retreat away and are not
pursued by Roswell.</p>

<p>Before he can return to the office and speak further with the team,
there&#39;s another commotion at the bank and a huge explosion. Customers
and smoke come billowing out of the bank, and Roswell charges in.</p>

<p>The team follows to see what is going on. Inside they find Roswell
and a number of other bandits. The bandits have used some sort of
explosive device to try to open the vault of the bank, but the
explosion by itself wasn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>Just as Roswell starts to turn and discuss why they&#39;ve left the
station with the group, the town clock strikes twelve. There&#39;s an
enormous earthquake &mdash; much bigger than the last and a giant
fissure opens up and swallows the team where they die.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>They find themself in a white plane with a woman in front of them.
She tells them they&#39;ll have to do better than that. And with a
strange sensation...</p>

<p>The team finds themselves waking up to the voice of <a href="#statlorf">High Vizier
Statlorf</a> in their ears. He informs them that there&#39;s been
a bit of an accident and he intended to send them to <strong>garbled</strong>, and
that he&#39;s looking for a magical cup.</p>

<p>Quickly realising they&#39;re in some kind of temporal loop the team
tries a number of other strategies. Each time resulting in their
death, either by the apocolyptic earthquake, or through their own
mistakes (often at the hand of Roswell).</p>

<p>Finally after following clues, and listening to the prophecy of a
witch named Poloma (who seemed to know they were in a loop), they
find their way to the mine where Jack and June were lost. With some
puzzle solving, they work their way into a giant room labeled &quot;Shaft
B&quot; in the middle of which is a massive shaft.  After some
consideration, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> leaps down the shaft and finds
that it touches the bottom of the bubble surrounding/protecting the
town. And outside the bubble is a massive purple worm, teeth the size
of buildings. Whereupon the apocolypse happens again and they return
once more to the garbled voice of Statlorf at the entrance of Refuge.
Now with the understanding, at least, of what is causing the
destruction.</p>

        <h3>11. Interlude: Leaving Refuge</h2>
        <h4>2019-06-20</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After discovering that the final conflagration in each time loop was
caused by a giant purple worm, the group set about discovering how to
stop it.</p>

<p>They made their way to Poloma the witch who told them that should
would be able to give them a major prophecy, but that the ritual
spell would require ten diamonds.</p>

<p>Immediate plans for a bank robbery were drafted, and executed. Many
diamonds were stolen. Bandits were vaporised. Banks were nearly
leveled. Ten diamonds were procurred.</p>

<p>The ritual began, and the witch uttered a single phrase; &quot;look to the
right&quot;.</p>

<p>With that cryptic advice, disappointed, the team made their way to
the fallen temple. They discovered it was a temple of the Goddess
Istus lady of fate, destiny, divination and the future. Nearby they
found a skeleton, still animated and alive who was once a priest to
Istus.</p>

<p>He Luca, and his brother Redmond, had been priests before the temple
crumbled because of sick time. But he believed that the temple could
be rebuilt if the adventurers could convince Redmond to assist him in
a ritual prayer.</p>

<p>And so they made their way to a stonefruit farm where they discovered
Redmond was the leader of the bandits and what planning to rob the
bank vault, believing that it held an artifact that could lower the
bubble and free the town from it&#39;s entrapment.</p>

<p>Now being expert bank robbers, the group offered their help. And so
began another bank robbery, this time only slight less bungled. In
the end however, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> was able to use his monk agility
to get into the vault.</p>

<p>There he discovered the diary of Sheriff Isaac, in which he
chronicled his lust for a magical cup that Jack possessed. Finally
Isaac could not resist the lure of the cup and murdered Jack by
pushing him down Shaft B in the mines. The cup, however, fell into
the hands of the nearby June, and around her &mdash; and the town
&mdash; a bubble was errected, and the clay golem Roswell was
summoned. June however, was incapacitated and stuck to the cup inside
another, smaller bubble.</p>

<p>Isaac described the shame and horror that he felt, and how he used
the word &quot;Junebug&quot; as the command word for Roswell, directing him to
protect the town of Refuge.</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge the team met another demise by way of
apocolypse and once again woke in front of Refuge.</p>

<p>This time, instead of negotiating or tricking Roswell, though, they
simply took control of him. From there they rushed to Redmond who
they convinced to help erect the Temple of Istus by promising him
Roswell&#39;s control word.</p>

<p>After the temple was mended, <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> communed with Istus who
provided them with a magical lance, which can pierce time bubbles. It
would not be able to pierce the larger bubble around the town without
some additional force, but would allow them to enter Shaft A.</p>

<p>So they ventured back to the mines and into Shaft A where they found
Isaac and June &mdash; and of course, the cup. June was unconscious,
inside the bubble with her hand resting on a magical chalice which
<a href="#salim">Salim</a> detected as being thoroughly evil. June also appeared
to be the same woman as who had been appearing to the team upon each
resurrection.</p>

<p>After some initial talk, Isaac thought he had the upper hand and
attempted to take the lance from them by force. He was immediately
incapacitated by a number of fireballs from <a href="#trist">Trist</a>.</p>

<p>Safely then <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> used the lance to burst the protective
time bubble surrounding June and the cup. The cup, however was
sentient to some degree. It spoke to each of the members, pulling
their most painful memories from the past and promising the ability
to go back in time and change them.</p>

<p>The team was resolute. They wrapped the cup in a safe covering. At
this moment, the final tremors began. June explained to the group
that they could open Shaft A and close Shaft B and lure the worm away
from the town.</p>

<p>And so everyone got into a mining cart. They distracted the worm by
having <a href="#trist">Trist</a> throw fireballs at it to get its attention.</p>

<p>Continuing down the shaft, the worm getting closer every minute.
Finally they came to a junction with a path to the left and the
right. Recalling the witches prophecy they chose the right path and
were launched into the air out of the mine tumbling toward the larger
bubble surrounding the whole town. Jimmy at the fore leveled the
lance and their momentum pushed them just far enough through to pop
the bubble.</p>

<p>And with that they found themselves back in <a href="#statlorf">Statlorf&#39;s</a>
tower.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>Finally having returned to their path towards the dragonborn twin
cities, the group found themselves on the road nearing dusk.</p>

<p>Rather than push forward through the night or camp in the forest,
they found their way to the small village of Gravesford. Upon
arriving at the local public house, the group found a large number of
commonfolk patrons enjoying their drink.</p>

<p>They found one in particular, a girl named Pinna, who was fascinated
by the adventurers. She invited herself to the table and wanted to
hear everything about them. Soon they learned that she was the local
witch, performing the magic required by the townsfolk to keep simple
life bearable.</p>

<p>After some time discussing magic, and their varying abilities in it,
the tavern was interrupted by the entry of a knight and his retinue.
He proclaimed his title, Sir Pellington, and declared that there was
a reward being offered by the new Baron for the head of a local orc
chieftain for the murder of the last Baron and his family.</p>

<p>Sir Pellington was quick to point out personally and in great detail
to any of the &quot;pathetic peasant rabble&quote; that they needn&#39;t
bother with the bounty as he would be the one to collect.</p>

<p>Eyeing the adventurers he approached their table and challenged <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> to defy him in this. Never one to back down from a
challenge, run from protecting the honour of the commonfolk, or miss
a chance to lose embarrassingly in public, the monk stood up and
suggested that they take the discussion outside.</p>

<p>Sir Pellington, not being the sort to accommodate a rather reasonable
request drew his sword and swung at <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a>. The two
manoeuvered for several minutes, trading blows neither unable to find
the upper hand. Eventually, Sir Pellington overstepped the line of
honourable bar brawling by calling forth eldritch strength and
blasting <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> with dark energy.</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> responded in kind, blasting Pellington and
several of his compatriots with the lightening stored in his ring.
From here the brawl devolved quickly into a serious altercation.</p>

<p>While the P-Team was unmatched and overpowered, they fought bravely.
<a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> summoning several creature from his bag of tricks,
<a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> and <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> were frozen solid by a
cold blast from Pellington, but <a href="#salim">Salim</a> with his draconic
lineage able to resist.</p>

<p>Eventually several of Pellington&#39;s attendants were killed, and the
P-Team was unconscious while the arrogant knight was forced to flee
with his last remaining squire.</p>

<p>Soon after, the group was revived from their swoons by Pinna and the
innkeeper. Through the judicious use of bribery they were able to
disuade the innkeeper from evicting them outright and eventually
headed to their rooms to recover themselves.</p>

<p>Several hours into the night they all awoke to the sounds of
explosions. Assuming that it was Pellington again, <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> and the others raced to the source where they found
instead the sacked house of their new friend Pinna, several dead
orcish bodies, but no young witch.</p>

<p>Looking into the distance they saw the raiding party glaring back at
them carrying a figure.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The team decided to wait until morning before pursuing the orcs. At
dawn they were awoken by a throng of townspeople preparing to make
their way into the forest in order to exact vengence on the orcs.</p>

<p><a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> and <a href="#salim">Salim</a> convinced the townspeople to
take up arms with the group and that together they would head into
the forest and vanquish the evil orcish threat. Evenvtually as they
reached the forest, the reality of the situation forced the
townspeople to reconsider their engagement in the affair and
ultimately it was left to the P-Team to pursue.</p>

<p>Following the path of the orcs was not difficult until they arrived
at a fork with a small contingent heading to the right and the larger
group going left. After some debate, the group decided to go left.</p>

<p>Soon after, <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> spotted a sentry&#39;s blind and loudly
proclaimed it, to be immediately pincushioned by arrows.</p>

<p>A truly embarassing combat for all involved followed, with the team
eventually the victors. Despite their better judgement <a href="#dr-phil">Dr.
Phil</a> convinced the others that they should take a break in
the orcish structure, and again they were beset by orcs only several
minutes after settling down.</p>

<p>After this, <a href="#salim">Salim</a> recalled a potion of stealthiness that
he&#39;d purchased from the goblin vendor in Delway. Without considering
the... versimilitude... of the goblin he quickly quaffed it and the
group felt a quiet bubble surround them.</p>

<p>They rested for a short period and then continued onward, this time
staying off the main path and following through the forest. <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> in the lead signaled a sound and movement ahead, but
the other two continued on and walked into a clearing with several
more orcs disposing of bodies in a pit with a shambling mass.
Another truly embarassing combat proceded, but resulted in a very
full shambling mass.</p>

<p>Finally, the group reached a clearing where they saw a large orcish
fort, manned by hundreds of orcs. They attempted to hide, but both
<a href="#salim">Salim</a> and <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> were too slow, only <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> was able to conceal himself.</p>

<p>An orc approached the two interlopers and demanded to know if they
were from the village. Thinking fast, and going on the theory that
the orcs were working for the Baron, <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> said as
much. The orcs, as it happened did not take kindly to any of the
Baron&#39;s men and closed in, ready to kill the two heroes. <a href="#dr-phil">Dr.
Phil</a> muttered a few works and opened a dimension door
somewhere on the parapats of the fort and dragged <a href="#salim">Salim</a>
through.</p>

<p>In the fort several orcs saw the heroes appear and the immediately
turn invisible. They knew their opponents were somwehere in the fort.</p>

<p>Throughout this, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> remained hidden on the edge of

<p>The two adventurers on the outside were able to spot a potential

otherside. Summoning <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> and with the help of the
dragonborne, they forced open the hidden door and were reunited.</p>

<p>After a period of rest to recuperate from the battles with the orcs,
the group began to steathily investigate the rest of the fort. They
found strange shamanic orcs brewing some perfidious potion, groups of
monster orcs larger than any they&#39;d ever seen asleep in barracks,
strange animated armours, and more.</p>

<p>Having explored all but one room and still unable to find Pinna, the
group was growing increasingly paranoid. They opened the final door,
and immediately the orcs inside were aware of the presence of
something.</p>

<p>They struck quickly, and were able to quietely dispatch of the two
orc hunters without them alerting the rest of the horde.</p>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>Not having found Pinna, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> insisted that they
continue searching the castle. The group agreed and they recalled
hearing voices in the tower that led down to the basement where <a href="#dr-phil">Dr.
Phil</a> and <a href="#salim">Salim</a> had found themselves when they
arrived.</p>

<p>They headed in that direction, and passed through a room surrounded
by magically enchanted armour that they believed would come to life,
but for one piece which looked incredible.</p>

<p>They worked their way up the spiral staircase, until <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> became possessed by a spectre, and bagan to attack
the group. <a href="#salim">Salim</a> was able to exorcise the creature, but
suffered greatly in the process when the ghost touched him and aged
him by thirty years.</p>

<p>Though the cost was great, they defeated the ghoat and found several
items of interest, the most important of which was the deed to the
keep, dubbed Castle Rend.</p>

<p>They continued up to the top, where they found the tower roof
collapsed. <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> attempted to take flight to view the
situation, but was quickly harried by arrows. With this the team
began to hear orc voices heading in their direction.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> sprinted down the stairs to the
armours and ripped the fine piece off of it&#39;s stand. This caused the
armours to come to life and attack. <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> held the deed
to the castle in front of him and attempted to command the automotas
but to no avail.</p>

<p><a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> touched the monk and with a slight popping
sound, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> found himself banished to the ethereal
plane, land of the dead. The automota immediately stopped attacking.</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> meanwhile found himslef surrounded by knights in the
ethereal realm who pointed at him and said -</p>

<p>&quot;Not yours&quot;, pointing at the deed
&quot;Give it back&quot;, pointing at the armour</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> understanding, apologised for the intrusion and
explained that they meant no harm. They were simply seeking out a
friend taken by the orcs.</p>

<p>&quot;The orcs have here&quot;
&quot;Speak with the orcs&quot;
&quot;Find the lord&quot;
&quot;Return the castle to him&quot;</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> agreed.</p>

<p>In the material plane, the automata returned to their stands and
rested. The rest of the group, meanwhile was confronted by hundreds
of orcs and taken into custody. They were stripped of their equipment
and dragged to the keep to speak with the orc leader.</p>

<p><a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> wandered the castle in the ethereal plane, trying
to find the keep, not knowing for sure how long he&#39;d been banished
for. Eventually he popped back into existence in the middle of the
courtyard of the keep where he found a female orc leader and two
children - Pinna and a young boy.</p>

<p>He too was stripped of his equipment, and the group begain to speak
with the orc queen. She asked them to prove that they were not agents
of the Baron, who&#39;d betrayed her. <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a>, with
permission, produced the tooth of Sir Pellington as evidence of their
opposition to the cruel lord.</p>

<p>This convinced the orcs who then demanded that if they wanted the
release of the hostages, they would have to find a long lost magical
banner of the white tusk clan. She believed it to be somewhere in the
castle.</p>

<p>They group discussed where it could be, and decided to send <a href="#su-yuan">Su
Yuan</a> back to the ethereal plane to commune again with the
dead knights to see if they knew. They revealed that such a banner
could be found in the deepest part of the castle in the crypts,
though it was guarded by a spectre similar to themselves, but lost
and perverted.</p>

<p>The group made their way to the crypt, where <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a>
unceremoniously banish the wraith back to the ethereal plane and they
found the banner.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, upon returning the banner, the orc queen kept
her promise and released the captives. The boy, as the group
suspected was the son of the previous baron whose family was killed.
He bestowed the deed to the castle on the adventurers, who also
called on one last favour of the orcs - to defend the castle and
defeat the baron. And finally he granted them the honour of
knighthood, which they accepted dubiously.</p>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The group set quickly about making preparations for the coming
battle. They directed the orc queen to send scouts to determine the
size and strength of the enemy forces.</p>

<p>At the same time <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a> made a trip into the forest to rally
the local druids to their cause. After a dangerous conversation the
druids agreed to aid the group in exchange for a promise that the
southern end of the forest be exempt from any logging or building.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a>, <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> and
<a href="#salim">Salim</a> made their way back to Gravesford with Pinna and the
young baron. Here they rallied help to their side.</p>

<p>They recruited the local workers to the fight against Pellington and
Saxton, while spending the majority of their gold on goods to do so.
They sent runners to the surrounding towns the do the same and to
spread the word of resistance. Finally they sent letters to Delway to
seek assistance from Lady Emilia.</p>

<p>After this the were approached by a strange halfling who claimed to
be serving Morcom Kester and brought news from their magical fountain
business far in the north.</p>

<p>The halfling explained that the southern kingdom was somehow involved
in supporting Pellington and Saxton. He&#39;d also brought several
magical items for the group; very powerful armour and weapons.</p>

<p>After this, the group returned to the castle, where they bestowed one
of the towers to Pinna to use as a research labority and magicerium.</p>

<p>The scouts had returned, with news. Pellington&#39;s forces were 900
strong, a mix of gnolls and humans. They brought with them Pellington
and his even more powerful sister, Brigidine - two of the seven
Knights of the Rose. Additionally they were accompanied by a powerful
wizard Morton. In the army were seige weapons and an elite heavy
infantry of Dragonborn.</p>

<p>The group had prepared for the combat and could do nothing more but
wait and hope that their strategy worked.</p>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The battle began. While both forces fought against one another,
Pellington and his retinue planned a strategic strike. Their mage
invoked a teleportation circle and an elite force appeared inside the
walls of Castle Rend. Their target was the gates. Were they to open
them, the advantage of defence that the group currently enjoyed would
be eliminated and the battle would most certainly be lost.</p>

<p><a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> and <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> had anticipated this
move and positioned themselves invisibly behind and striking
silently. <a href="#dr-phil">Dr. Phil</a> polymorphed the mage into a frog,
while <a href="#su-yuan">Su Yuan</a> placed him inside of his bag of holding,
neutralising the magic user.</p>

<p><a href="#salim">Salim</a> summoned Authority who dispatched with Pellington&#39;s
sister before marking his debt as paid.</p>

<p>The remainder of the group stood no chance, including Pellington
himself who was cut down by a blast of eldritch energy from <a href="#dr-phil">Dr.
Phil</a>, and continuous lightening strikes from a storm
summoned by <a href="#jimmy">Jimmy</a>.</p>

<p>With the defeat of Pellington&#39;s army, the group decided that they
would leave the command of Castle Rend to the young lord. They sent
word to Morcom Kester that they would be heading to the twin
dragonborn cities. <a href="#salim">Salim&#39;s</a> home.</p>
