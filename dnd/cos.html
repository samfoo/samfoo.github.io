        <h3>1. Instantiation</h2>
        <h4>2018-11-24</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>A seasoned band of adventurers found their way to a remote inn after
being accosted by bandits many times deep into the Sword Coast.</p>

<p>After some much needed food, ale and milk, a colourfully dressed
gypsey burst into the inn and approached the adventurers, speaking
directly to them. He informed them that his master was in need of
their service and presented them with a letter of invitation to the
land of Barovia.</p>

<p>After a long night&#39;s rest, the group agreed to heed the letter&#39;s
instructions and headed down the old Svalich road towards Barovia.
Eventually, strange mists engulfed them.  Nature warped around them.</p>

<p>After being harried by a large group of direwolves, the group
eventually arrived in the Village of Barovia just as night was
falling. There they learned the land of Barovia is ruled by a cruel
tyrant vampire lord named Strahd van Zarovich.</p>

<p>Eventually they met Ismark, son of the burgermaster, and reluctantly
agreed to help him and his sister Ireena who has been harrassed by
Strahd for several weeks.</p>

<p>As the group went with Ismark to his manor, they found Ireena. And
they found Strahd. Strahd bites Ireena, leaving her incapacitated,
and welcomes the group to Barovia. He then disappears, transmogrified
into a swarm of bats.</p>

<p>After stabilising Ireena and calming her and Ismark, the crew agrees
to escort her to the town of Vallaki where Ismark believes she will
be safe at St. Andal&#39;s church.</p>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The adventurers make their way from the Village of Barovia down the
Svalich Road towards Vallaki. They come across Tser Pool, an
encampment of Vistani. Amongst them is Madam Eva, a Vistana
soothsayer who takes the fortune of each member of the party,
revealing to them some more details of Strahd and hinting that there
might be some items that can be used to destroy him and release the
curse.</p>

<p>After thanking the Vistani for their hospitality, the group continued
up the Svalich Road. Eventually they arrived at a bridge crossing
Tser Falls where they found Strahd himself.</p>

<p>Immediately, <a href="#thaddeus">Thaddeus</a> challenged him to a duel, which
Strahd accepted. Eventually the paladin was killed, and Strahd once
again, disappeared virtually unharmed.</p>

<p><a href="#pip">Pip</a>, taking <a href="#thaddeus">Thaddeus</a>&#39; horse galloped towards
Vallaki as fast as he could. The rest of the group barely able to
keep up.</p>

<p>Finally the team arrived at the Blue Waters inn. <a href="#pip">Pip</a> was
inconsolible, and the rest of the party was shaken to their core.</p>

        <h3>5. Ezmerelda</h2>
        <h4>2019-01-05</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>Having been brought back to the Church of St. Andal, the adventurers
found themselves udner the ire of the burgermaster for causing
trouble in town with the vampire spawn. <a href="#astrid">Astrid</a> had gone
missing somehow in her escape from the coffin maker&#39;s shop.</p>

<p>The burgermaster&#39;s henchman, Izek, approached them at the church, and
told them they were to accompany him back to speak with the
burgermaster, who would decide their fate. <a href="#elf">Elf</a> made no secret
of his hatred of Izek, but before it could come to blows, <a href="#pip">Pip</a>
talked him down.</p>

<p>The crew accompanied Izek to the burgermaster where they were
presented with an ultimatum; Deliver a strange vistana woman to him
or be convicted of collaborating against the safety of the town and
hanged in the town square.</p>

<p>The team agreed to the ultimatum, despite <a href="#elf">Elf&#39;s</a> apprehension
about Izek. At the same time <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> declared his
intention to accompany the team.</p>

<p>After leaving the burgermaster&#39;s manse, the team made their way
towards Van Richten&#39;s tower where they&#39;d been told the vistana woman
had last been seen. On arriving they found a wagon with a sign &quot;Keep
Out&quot;. Unable to resist, <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> opened the front door and
triggered a trap exploding the entire cart and it&#39;s contents and
leaving billowing black clouds of smoke floating into the air.</p>

<p>After licking their wounds, the team made their way into the tower
where they were able to command golems to control a lift to a room up
top. After some experimentation they found, hidden behind an animated
suite of armour, the Tome of Strahd. The book explained, in Strahd&#39;s
own words, how he became a vampyr through a pact with Vol. His love
for Tatyana, and how he killed his brother.</p>

<p>It also described his fear of a sword of light, and the sun.</p>

<p>Not long into their investigation, they heard a woman&#39;s voice cry
&quot;What the f&amp;^*k&quot; outside. Looking out they saw a woman and further in
the distance a number of large wolves converging on the tower.</p>

<p>Despite their guilt in the destruction of the wagon, the team were
able to convince Ezmerelda of their good intentions, and besides; as
the wolves converged now was not the time for bickering amongst the
desperate.</p>

<p>Together, the group fought with Ezmerelda and was able to kill or
drive back the wolves and (it turns out) werewolves that were
attacking. <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> and <a href="#pip">Pip</a> learned quickly that
the werewolves were immune to regular weapons, but vulnerable to
magic and silver.</p>

<p>After the defeat of the werewolves, the team was left to determine
what they were to do with Ezmerelda and how they were going to deal
with Izek and the burgermaster.</p>

        <h3>6. Wizards of Wine</h2>
        <h4>2019-07-06</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After the defeat of the werewolves, and licking their wounds, the
group had to decide on their next course of action. <a href="#elf">Elf</a> left
on his own to find out why the werewolves were working with Strahd.
<a href="#astrid">Astrid</a> was still missing, and the rest of the group feared
the worst.</p>

<p>They considered their options;</p>

<p>First, they had found both their prophesised partner (Ezmerelda) and
the Tome of Strahd. From the clues that they have, they believe
another artifact can be found in the ruins of Berez.</p>

<p>Second, they also knew that another artifact resides in a saint&#39;s
house. Ezmerelda informed them that she&#39;d been staying at the Abbey
of Saint Markovia in the village of Krezk, which seemed to fit the
description.</p>

<p>Finally, they&#39;d agreed with the Martikovs in Vallaki to investigate
why the wine shipments had ceased.</p>

<p>After some deliberations, they agreed that before seeking out further
artifacts, they needed to gather supplies. If they wanted to get
supplies, they&#39;d need some kind of currency or favours, and resolving
the winery problem seemed as good a plan as any.</p>

<p>They also revealed to Ez how the mayor of Vallaki asked them to
return her to him, but as they are not sympathetic to the mayor they
chose not to do so.</p>

<p>And so the two remaining members of the party, <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a>
and <a href="#pip">Pip</a> set off with Ez to the Wizards of Wine Winery. After
a long day on the road they began to approach the vinyards where they
found several strange creatures beckoning.</p>

<p>As they drew closer to investigate, they found it was Davian
Martikov, the owner of the winery. He explained how the winery had
been taken over by blights and druids five days prior.
<a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> and <a href="#pip">Pip</a> agreed to investigate if they
were remunerated in kinds.</p>

<p>They drew close to the winery, but despite their uneasy feelings they
saw no sign of druid or blight. Just as they began to enter the
building however, from the vinyard they came.</p>

<p>Hundreds of blights.</p>

<p>As the battle raged, further blights and druids emerged from the
winery building. The group held their own, but the odds were nearly
insurmountable. The final remaining blights began to overtake them
and both <a href="#pip">Pip</a> and <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> fell. Ezmerelda standing
alone was able to dispatch the final creatures and perform some basic
first aide on the two fallen adventurers.</p>

<p>Once again, they felt the weight of danger in Strahd&#39;s Barovia. They
skulked into the stables of the winery where they were able to have a
brief respite.</p>

<p>After they&#39;d recouped, the group began to investigate, door by door,
the winery. Eventually they found another group of druids, but this
time were prepared and dispatched them professionally before the
perverted creatures could mount any resistance. Upon one of them
<a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> found a magical staff that could be used to
destroy blights.</p>

<p>Finally they were happy that the winery was secure, and they went to
Davian Martikov. He paid them with silver ingots, and allowed them to
rest at the winery as long as they needed. He also agreed to restart
shipments to Urwin in Vallaki immediately, despite his hatred of his
son.</p>

<p>As they group discussed the winery with Davian further, he revealed
that there were three magical gems which were planted in the fields
which allowed the grapes to grow. Without them no further wine could
be produced. One gem was lost when Urwin was on watch years ago.
Another was lost when it was stolen by scarecrow creatures several
weeks past. Davian believe this to be hidden in the ruins of Berez.</p>

<p>The last gem had been stolen five days ago by the druids. He also
believed this to be taken to their holy ground in Yester Hill not far
from the vinyard.</p>

        <h3>7. Next Steps</h2>
        <h4>2019-07-15</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After several weeks of rest and recuperation at the Winery as the
guests of the Martikovs the adventurers again grew anxious. It had
been some times since they&#39;d heard from <a href="#elf">Elf</a> and they feared
the worst. <a href="#astrid">Astrid</a> was still missing and they presumed dead
or worse.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to give up on waiting and continue their
quest with only <a href="#pip">Pip</a>, <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> and
<a href="#ezmerelda">Ezmerelda</a> the group was greated by a nonplussed
<a href="#elf">Elf</a> returned from the hunt.</p>

<p>He revealed that he&#39;d discovered that the group of werewolves who
attacked them at Von Richten&#39;s tower had a den in the hills to the
west of Lake Baratok. He&#39;d tracked them there and followed their
movements for nearly a week. During that time he learned the there
had been a political schism amongst the pack. Some amongst them were
kidnapping local children, arming them and forcing them to fight to
the death. The winner of several fights was deemed the strongest and
infected with lycanthropy, thus ensuring the strenght of the pack.
The leader of this faction was named Kiril. </p>

<p>The other faction was led by one named Emil. <a href="#elf">Elf</a> didn&#39;t know
the details of Emil&#39;s politics but knew that the key disagreement
between the groups was the child fighting.</p>

<p>Kiril disappeared one day and came back accompanied by dire wolves
and others loyal to Strahd, and Emil was captured and taken to Castle
Ravenloft.</p>

<p>With that, <a href="#elf">Elf</a> had fled, now understanding the gravity of the
situation in which werewolves and vampires had aligned themselves.
Several days later he had tracked the rest of the group to the winery
and reunited.</p>

<p>After some discussion <a href="#pip">Pip</a> and <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> agreed that
they couldn&#39;t allow child death matches. However, they also knew they
couldn&#39;t face werewolves without silver weapons. And the only place
to get any kind of weapons in Barovia is the Vistani.</p>

<p>The group made their way to the Vistani camp outside of Vallaki. Here
they agreed with the two leaders that in exchange for finding their
daughter, who&#39;d disappeared several days before, the vistani
craftsmen would augment several arrows for <a href="#elf">Elf</a> with silver,
and replace the head of <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj&#39;s</a> shovel with silver.</p>

<p><a href="#elf">Elf</a> quickly found the trail of the lost girl and tracked her
to the southern shore of Lake Zarovich. With keen eyes they spotted a
figure in a boat several hundred metres out dumping a burlap sack
overboard. They rushed and found it was the girl, and were only just
able to save her from a terrifying death by drowning.</p>

<p>The man who&#39;d thrown her overboard was simple, though the group
didn&#39;t wait for much explanation. <a href="#pip">Pip</a> smashed through the
man&#39;s boat and, being unable to swim, left him to die the same death
he&#39;d intended for the girl.</p>

<p>After bringing her back, the group had earned the promised favour
from the vistani, and were given the weapons they needed to defeat
werewolves.</p>

        <h3>8. The Werewolves</h2>
        <h4>2019-07-31</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After they&#39;d secured their new weapons, the group followed
<a href="#elf">Elf</a> as he led them through to Barovian back woods to where
the werewolve den lay. Hewn into the side of a mountain, the den was
a large cave whose entrance formed the visage of a howling wolf.</p>

<p>Cautiously they approached, taking their time and observing.
<a href="#elf">Elf</a> informed them that seven of the wolves had left and
traveled far enough away that they could safely approach the den.</p>

<p>Upon entering they found two sentries and immediately engaged them.
The sentries raised the alarm in the cave and they were joined by
four others.</p>

<p>In the fray, <a href="#ezmerelda">Ezmerelda</a> was bitten horribly and could
feel the beginnings of the lycanthropis virus infecting her.</p>

<p>Before they could stop them, one of the wolves made it to the
entrance and howled loudly across the valley. <a href="#elf">Elf</a> could sense
the others coming.</p>

<p>The group was in no position to face off against seven more of the
beasts, especially not in the state that <a href="#ezmerelda">Ez</a> was in.
Instead they chose to flee. With the skillful survival acumen of
<a href="#elf">Elf</a> they were able to safely get away for a time.
Unfortunately, there was nothing to be done for
<a href="#ezmerelda">Ezmerelda</a>&#39;s condition unless they could find wolfsbane,
which was rare in these part of the forest. The group was exhausted
at this point and the danger of pushing further while tired or
resting and moving with a clear head the next day weighed on them.</p>

<p>They chose to setup camp for the night, and posted a watch. On the
second watch deep into the night <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> heard something.
He awoke <a href="#pip">Pip</a> and roused <a href="#elf">Elf</a> from his meditation. From
the rustling they heard a loud howl of identification. Though they
dispatched of this lone wolf before he could escape, the six others
knew their position again and approached.</p>

<p>The group steeled themselves for what they feared may be their final
stand.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>As the werewolves closed in, the group prepared for the worst. The
attack came swiftly. A group of four direwolves and three werewolves.
<a href="#ezmeralda">Ez</a> used the the of her strength to cast greater
invisibility on <a href="#elf">Elf</a>.</p>

<p>Both <a href="#pip">Pip</a> and <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> confronted the werewolves

<a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> sweeping the foul creatures off their feet and
<a href="#pip">Pip</a> smashing them with Lightbringer.</p>

<p>Two direwolves pulled off from the pack to focus on the near
catatonic <a href="#ezmeralda">Ezmeralda</a>, focused only on trying to maintin
her concentration in hiding the errant archer.</p>

<p>As the wolves closed in, arrows appeared out of nowhere, piercing
their hearts and slaying the beasts. The effort was too much,
however, and the vistana swooned to the ground and the elf was
revealed.</p>

<p>The final werewolf saw that the situation was turning and attempeted
to flee. At this, <a href="#elf">Elf</a> held out a single silver arrow, closed
his eyes and muttered a small incantation and let fly an ensnaring
strike.</p>

<p>The lycanthrope was rooted to the spot and <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> and
<a href="#pip">Pip</a> closed in, the creature&#39;s death inevitable as the paladin
exacted his oath of vengance.</p>

<p>After the battle, the group could still hear the howls and feel other
werewolves closing in on them. Exhausted they swiftly moved through
the forest eventually reaching the Old Svalich Road. As they worked
their way towards the closest safe haven they knew of, The Wizards of
Wine Winery, they were once more beset. This time by fearsome
scarecrow creatures. Animated by some dark magic and imbued with an
arcane ability to cause fear.</p>

<p>Despite their exhaustion the group was able to dispatch of the
creatures quickly and stumble on death&#39;s to the safety of the winery.</p>

<p>Therein they spoke with Davian Martikov about the virus currently
afflicting <a href="#ezmeralda">Ezmeralda</a>. The Martikovs, themselves
lycanthropes, were familiar with the disease and the old patriarch
used a strange mixture of herbs to stall the infection and
artificially sedate the vistana until the group could find some
wolfsbane.</p>

<p>The only place to find wolfsbane in Barovia is high in the mountains
in the Tsolenka Pass. Davian warned them, however, that the pass was
home to a fearsome Roc.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <p><a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a>, <a href="#pip">Pip</a>, and <a href="#elf">Elf</a> began to make their
way towards Mount Baratok, on a path that would lead them through
Tsolenka Pass.</p>

<p>Before making thei way into the cold and desolate elevation they
spent some time hunting in the woods to get enough skins to resist
the cold.</p>

<p>Several days later, and several nights spend in the far reaches of
uncivilised Barovia, they made their way up a rapidly narrowing path
and saw a gatehouse built into the side of the mountain. On
investigation, there was a large portculus blocking the road and
inside the gatehouse a wall of arcane green flame.</p>

<p><a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> was able to pry up enough of a stone to allow
<a href="#elf">Elf</a> underneath the portculus. On reaching the opposite side,
the gate creaked and opened of its own accord.</p>

<p>The group clamered in and found the warmth of the green flame
inviting. Experimenting a bit they found that the flame didn&#39;t burn
objects, but they themselves could feel the heat.</p>

<p><a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> decided to dash through the flame to the other
side and investigate. He steeled himself and ran forward, burning
horribly in the process... but making it through the exit to the
other side.  After some searching, he luckily found several sprigs of
wolfsbane in the snow on the other side, white flowers blooming in
the dark.</p>

<p>While this was transpiring, <a href="#pip">Pip</a> spent some time praying and
so was able to detect the presence of two nearby fiends. Fiends that
were, in fact, just on top of the gatehouse.</p>

<p><a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a>, badly burnt from the first run through the
magical flame tied a rope around his waist and threw it to the others
on the other side. &quot;If I&#39;m unable to make it through, pull with all
your might&quot;, he said. And with that, he braved the flames again. This
time his resolve faltered and he fell in pain. <a href="#pip">Pip</a> and
<a href="#elf">Elf</a> quickly pulling him the rest of the way through.</p>

<p>Successful in their mission to acquire the herb, the group resolved
to head back immediately to <a href="#ezmeralda">Ez</a>. <a href="#pip">Pip</a> let the
others know to be cautious of the nearby fiends, unaware of their
intentions or goals.</p>

<p><a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> recalling his training in the church called out
in the language of the infernals, asking if the fiends are all right
and saying that they were leaving now.</p>

<p>The fiends, unhappy with this screeched for him to quiet himself in
reply. Several more attempts to communicate were likewise rebuffed,
until finally the fiends had enough and attacked the group.  The
battle was fierce, but ultimately the fiends retreated back to the
top of the guardhouse.</p>

<p>The group made their way back to the winery and delivered the herbs
to Davian Martikov, who administered a concoction to the infected
vistana.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After being administered the tincture that will clear her of
lycanthrope before it can take root, <a href="#ezmeralda">Ezmeralda</a> required
several weeks of recovery time.</p>

<p>The group discussed their options and decided that, in recompense for
the work of the Martikovs that they would seek out the magical gems
taken from the winery. They knew of the locations of two of them. The
first was taken by the druids and Davian suspected they&#39;d brought it
to some unholy ritual in Yester Hill to the south. The second was
stolen by the scarecrows of Baba Lysaga during one of the raids.
Davian assumes that it has been brought to the evil witch in the
ruins of the city of Berez.</p>

<p>They decided to retrieve the Yester Hill stone first. They made their
way during the day to Yester Hill arriving just as night fell.
Cautiously they observed the hill being struck by lightening several
times, and soon an uncanny fog rose to ungulf the top of the hill,
and then after several moments, just as quickly disapated.</p>

<p><a href="#pip">Pip</a> could feel the presence of undead nearby, but as the fog
pulled back so did that sense. <a href="#elf">Elf</a> circled around the hill
and found a group of druids and blights around a small copse of
trees. <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> and <a href="#pip">Pip</a> approached the summit of
the hill, surrounded by tall walls of boulders. Inside the ring of
boulders they found a giant statue of Strahd von Zarovich himself.</p>

<p>As <a href="#elf">Elf</a> watched, the chanting grew louder and appeared to be
approaching a crescendo. <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> taking confidence in his
magical staff of Gulthias approached the blights and tried to engage
the druids. The blights blocked his pass, but otherwise seem
compelled to remain friendly to him by the staff he carried.</p>

<p>Finally <a href="#elf">Elf</a>&#39;s sense of danger with the ritual was too much
and he loosed several arrows killing one of the druids. Upon this,
haggard mountain men with long beards, smeared with dirt emerged from
hidden mounds in the circle of boulders, cutting off
<a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> from <a href="#pip">Pip</a>. And they attacked.</p>

<p><a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> was caught unawares by the bezerkers and was
struck heavily by three of them in quick succession. Just as the
attack began the druid&#39;s ritual ended, and a silence briefly covered
the hill before a giant evil treant creature burst from the center of
the wooden statue enraged with a green glow pulsing in its chest.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a>, despite his injuries too the
staff of Gulthias, and snapped it with all his strength across his
knee. A shock wave of arcane power eminated from the broken staff
affecting all blights in the surrounding area. The wave seemed to
remove the very connections of the fibres of their being and they
slowly disintegrated. The giant treant took several steps forward,
but he too was slowly turned to wisping ash in the wind.</p>

<p>Just as <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> did this, he was struck by several more
savage blows from the bezerk mountain men around him. His sacrifice
saved <a href="#pip">Pip</a> and <a href="#elf">Elf</a>, but he died there on the hill.</p>

<p>Seeing this, and seeing that at the foot of where Wintersplinter the
treant was moments ago was a glowing green gem, <a href="#pip">Pip</a> quickly
scooped it up and began to hastily retreat. <a href="#elf">Elf</a> covered the
retreat, killing more of the druids and mountain savages as tears
filled his eyes.</p>

<p>The remaining two members of the team just as they reached safety at
the edge of the forest surrounding the hill looked back. There they
saw the same strange mist as before coalesce into Strahd von
Zarovich. The vampire lord looked directly at them, bowed with great
aplumb, and picked up the Tome of Strahd - his tome - from the now
dead body of <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> the Shovel Knight.</p>

        <h4>2019-09-11</h4>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After the death of <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a>, <a href="#pip">Pip</a> and <a href="#elf">Elf</a>
were able to rendezvous in the forest around Yester Hill. Pushing
aside their grief they headed back towards the winery, at least
having accomplished their goal of retrieving the magical gem for
Davian, despite the heavy cost.</p>

<p>As they approached the winery Davian met them outside and quickly
ushered them in asking for help. He&#39;d found an unconscious man in the
fields of the winery. <a href="#pip">Pip</a> laid hands upon him and summoned
divine energy to bring life back to man, who awoke gasping and
confused.</p>

<p>Emotions frayed and tested to their limits, after a brief
introduction and ascertaining that he was not a threat or an agent of
Strahd in anyway they could detect, the two adventurers went to their
rooms to mourn their fallen friend.</p>

<p>The wanderer, confused and disoriented attempted to reach out with
divination magic. The magical link between him and his patron was
redirected to a new voice. One that mocked him and drew out his
darkest thoughts. This new voice must be Strahd, he thought, and
vowed then to put an end to this blight.</p>

<p>After a long night&#39;s rest, <a href="#elf">Elf</a> ventured down and spoke with
Davian and the strange man. He introduced himself as <a href="#pete">Pete, the
Wanderer</a>. He was brought to Barovia by his patron angel who
sent him to assist adventurers in eradicating the curse of Strahd.</p>

<p><a href="#elf">Elf</a> remained sceptical of this strange man, and went to check
on <a href="#ezmeralda">Ezmeralda</a>. <a href="#pete">Pete</a> followed along and
immediately recognising that she was still battling the lycanthropic
infection, despite the wolfsbane, he touched her forehead and
summoned his divine energy to cure her of her curse.</p>

<p>She awoke slowly, weak from her days in traction, but alive and fully
well once again. She thanked this strange man, and immediately asked
where <a href="#pip">Pip</a> and <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> were. Fresh tears entered
<a href="#elf">Elf</a>&#39;s eyes as he relayed the last few weeks to to vistana.</p>

<p><a href="#ezmeralda">Ezmeralda</a> then demanded to see <a href="#pip">Pip</a>, who had
isolated himself in his room with his grief. She spoke to him quietly
about the pain of losing so many loved ones in such a short time
period and how the only cure for this is vengeance. With this his
demeaner changed and he focused his attention and power once again.
Strahd must die.</p>

<p>But first, the group agreed they must retrieve the body of
<a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> and give him a proper burial rite. And so they
set off again for Yester Hill this time accompanied by the strange
wandering cleric instead of the Shovel Knight.</p>

<p>Upon arrival they found the druidic hill abandoned by it&#39;s perverted
worshipers. No more berzerkers nor druids. Only a crucifix with the
flayed and dead body of their friend <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a> remained.</p>

<p>They brought him down and laid him to rest, but not before each
saying a small word to honor the man. One of the few Barovians to
stand up to the tyrant and fight back. They promised they would
avenge him.</p>

        <h4>2019-10-02</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After performing proper rites for <a href="#milivoj">Milivoj</a>, the group
returned to the winery where they rested for some time, and discussed
their next moves.</p>

<p>After deliberating for quite some time, they ultimately decided that
they would return to the town of Vallaki and confront the
burgermaster. Doing so would mean they&#39;d no longer be personas non
grata there, and would be able to draw on the resources of some of
the friendly townsfolk (including Urwin Martikov).</p>

<p>They thanked Davian for all of his help, and promised him that they&#39;d
retrieve another of the missing gems from Baba Lysaga after freeing
Vallaki.</p>

<p>They departed and began working their way back along the now familiar
Svalich Road towards Vallaki. Some time into their second day on the
road they spotted a raven high in the sky looking down on them. It
swooped down and transformed into a woman in front of them.</p>

<p>The woman introduced herself as <a href="#muriel">Muriel Vinshaw</a>. A
wereraven stationed in the ruins of Berez. She had been returning to
discuss some of her findings when she spotted the adventurers.</p>

<p>After just a brief time, and some confirmation that she wasn&#39;t an
agent of Strahd, the group invited her to accompany them to Vallaki.
Her local knowledge would be invaluable. She agreed.</p>

<p>With <a href="#muriel">Muriel</a> in tow, the team now discussed their plans.
They would send in <a href="#pip">Pip</a> to try to lure out the burgermaster or
his henchman with the demonic arm, Izek, out onto the road where they
could be ambushed. They&#39;d do so by using <a href="#ezmeralda">Ezmeralda</a> as
bait.</p>

<p><a href="#pip">Pip</a> made his way to the village, leaving the others several
kilometers outside in the woods. <a href="#muriel">Muriel</a> flew high above in
raven form, keeping watch. The guards stopped the young paladin
immediately, and he demanded to speak with the burgermaster. The
guards had been made aware that the adventurers were fugitives and
immediately took him into custody and led him to a building in town
to wait while they fetched Izek to speak with him.</p>

<p>Izek&#39;s arrived and wasn&#39;t taken in by the ruse or attempt to get him
out of town. Izek ordered his guards to torture <a href="#pip">Pip</a> until he
told them where <a href="#ezmeralda">Ezmeralda</a> and the others were. Izek
then left to speak on the matter with the burgermaster.</p>

<p><a href="#muriel">Muriel</a>, being the clever sort, realised after a few
minutes that <a href="#pip">Pip</a> was in quite the bind, and landed quietly in
a nearby alleyway, where she summoned the help of several resident
spiders by enlarging them and immobilising the guards while
<a href="#pip">Pip</a> was able to escape.</p>

<p>She then headed back to the group to tell them of what had
transpired. <a href="#pip">Pip</a> meanwhile began to work his way towards the
Blue Water Inn where he knew he could trust the Martikovs.</p>

<p><a href="#muriel">Muriel</a> arrived back and informed <a href="#pete">Pete</a>,
<a href="#ezmeralda">Ezmeralda</a> and <a href="#elf">Elf</a> of the situation, then
quickly took flight again back to assist <a href="#pip">Pip</a>.</p>

<p>The others meanwhile began a very fast jog towards Vallaki. Once they
neared the gates, from some distance away still, they saw a large
number of town guards amassing and waiting. <a href="#elf">Elf</a>, not being
the patient sort, started firing arrows at them, killing several
before the remaining guards took cover.  <a href="#pete">Pete</a> began working
his way towards the gate.</p>

<p><a href="#muriel">Muriel</a> arrived back in Vallaki to find Izek gathering a
group of many civilians with pitchforks to storm the woods and find
the adventurers. Thinking quickly, she landed in the middle of the
group and, using magical means, charmed Izek into thinking her a
friendly. After this, she convinced him that he and she should leave
the town alone, to which he agreed and dispersed the crowd.</p>

<p>The ruse worked and she led Izek into the waiting arms of the
adventurers who killed him, but not until they dispelled the magic in
his arm and it shriveled away into nothing. He was left powerless and
stripped on the road, no longer able to terrorise people.</p>

            <p>Having dispatched with Izek, the group discussed their next course of
action. Eventually they decided that they were unable to abide
leaving the burgomaster to terrorise the village with his mock-happy
ceremonies.</p>

<p>They hatched a plan where <a href="#pete">Pete</a> and <a href="#muriel">Muriel</a> would
make their way into town and lure out the burgomaster where he could
be confronted. A very original plan.</p>

<p>It worked largely without a hitch. <a href="#muriel">Muriel</a> was able to
sneak in and trick the burgomaster into leaving his home. She led him
(with his two mastiffs) to an alley where <a href="#pete">Pete</a> was waiting.
They killed him, but not before he blew a whistle alerting the
remainder of the town&#39;s guard.</p>

<p>They swiftly fled, mission accomplished, back to the others.</p>

<p>With this they decided they were done with Vallaki and they would
head to the ruins of Berez, where they&#39;d retrieve the Sunsword and
the missing gem for Davian.</p>

<p>After some time traveling through the bog, they arrived and carefully
surveyed the area. They knew from <a href="#muriel">Muriel</a> that there was a
mansion in town as well as Baba Lysaga&#39;s magical moving hut.</p>

<p>They first headed to the mansion where they found the ghost of the
former burgomaster who relayed the sad history of how Berez became
ruins. He also revealed the hidden location of the sunsword. After
retrieving the sword, they were beset by shambling undead creatures.
<a href="#pete">Pete</a> quickly dispatched of them, but the bloated corpses
were filled with snakes. <a href="#muriel">Muriel</a> spoke with the snakes and
discovered they hungered. She promised them a large feast of goats
and the group led them back to a pen they found earlier.</p>

<p>Since there was no door, <a href="#pete">Pete</a> smashed the wood and set off
an alarm of sorts. Quickly hiding in the nearby mansion, they watched
as scarecrows and eventually an evil hag approached.</p>

<p>The hag rode a magical giant skull as a vehicle. <a href="#muriel">Muriel</a>
dispeled the magic and she came crashing to the ground, now fully
aware of the group and angry.</p>

group was prepared. She surprised them with the power of her spell

Martikovs.</p>

<p>So the team traveled again across the now familiar Svalich raod back
to the Wizards of Wine Winery. Davian greeted them now as friends and

<p>In the morning the group decided that they would head to the village
of Krezk where they knew Saint Markovia&#39;s abbey resided. Here, they
knew lay the last remaining artifact - the Icon of Ravenkind.</p>

<p>On arriving in Krezk, they were told to wait outside the gates for
the burgomaster. When he came, he questioned them until he realised
they were the ones responsible for the return of the wine shipments.
Cautiously, he let them in and gave them a cabin in which they could
stay the night.</p>

<p>The group awoke the next morning and went to question the burgomaster
further. They learned that his son had recently passed away. They
asked about the strange happenings in the Abbey, and they were given

<li>There are strange sounds and lights coming from the abbey at night.</li>

<p><a href="#thaddeus">Thaddeus</a> appeared from the smoke, and entreated
<a href="#pip">Pip</a> to join him once again and defeat Strahd, and take over

mentor had on him he knew this was just a shell that Strahd was using
to toy with his emotions. With this rejection, <a href="#thaddeus">Thaddeus</a>
