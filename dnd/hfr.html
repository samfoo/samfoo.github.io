        <h3>1. Escorting Cargo</h2>
        <h4>2019-09-25</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The group was commissioned by a dwarvish miner, <a href="#gundren">Gundren
Rockseeker</a> in Neverwinter to escort some mining equipment
to a frontier town by the name of Phandelen. After several
uneventful days on the road, they came across several dead horses in
the middle of the road.</p>

<p>They approached cautiously and found it was a trap layed by several
nearby goblins. They truned the tables and ambushed the goblins,
killing the foul beasts.</p>

<p>Afterwards, some investigation revealed a path into the woods covered
in goblin footprints. They decided to tie their horses and cart up
and investigate the path.</p>

<p>Soon they arrived at a cave that was guarded by several goblins.
<a href="#bob">Bob</a> was able to charm one of the goblins and convince him
that they were friends. The team questioned the goblin and learned of
a human prisoner being held in the cave, and a large bugbear named
Klarg leading the goblin troupe.</p>

<p>They decided to rescue the prisoner. <a href="#keijo">Keijo</a> was sent in
first to explore, and after passing some guard dogs tied up at the
entrance found a passageway to what he believed was the cavern where
the goblin described the prisoner being held. Being unable to see in
the pitch black, he called out to the others who joined him.</p>

<p>They made their way up a steep and tight passageway, eventually
finding several sleeping goblins and a larger goblin cooking
something foul over a fire. In the corner they spotted the prisoner.</p>

<p><a href="#larry">Larry</a> used arcane power to communicate with the prisoner
and let him know they were there to free him. <a href="#keijo">Keijo</a>
silently killed several goblins until he was seen and the rest of the
group attacked at once.</p>

<p>After defeating the goblins, they freed the prisoner who revealed his
name was <a href="#sildar">Sildar</a> and that was an associate of
<a href="#gundren">Gundren&#39;s</a>. He revealed some more details about
<a href="#klarg">Klarg</a>...</p>

        <h3>2. Phandalen</h2>
        <h4>2019-10-03</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After rescuing Sildar, the group worked their way back to the main
road and their wagons. Upon arriving back, they found a half orc
gravely wounded resting against the wheel. Sildar immediately
recognised him as <a href="#orgrad">Orgrad</a> and explained to the raiders that
he was one of the mercenaries hired by Gundren to travel with him and
Sildar to Phandalen.</p>

<p>Sildar explained that while he and Gundren were abducted, they
weren&#39;t sure what had happened to Orgrad and had assumed he died.
<a href="#barry">Barry</a> stabilised the half orc and, confirming that he was
able to walk, they began to head towards Phandalen.</p>

<p>They arrived in the town without further incident and headed towards
the local inn where Sildar promised to get them rooms. Exhausted at
this point, they slept.</p>

<p>Arising in the morning they found Sildar had already left on
business. The raiders went out to replenish some supplies and see if
they could find news of Gundren.</p>

<p>They learned that no one had seen Gundren or his brothers for several
weeks. The town locals were mostly preoccupied with the local
ruffians who&#39;d dubbed themselves the Redbrands. They were terrorising
the shops and homes and generally causing problems.</p>

<p>They met Sildar back in the inn where he paid them for their
services, and told them that he would be preoccupied with looking for
a wizard friend of his who had disappeared, last having been seen
heading towards the manor which the Redbrands used as their
headquarters.</p>

<p>The raiders agreed to look for him, and were also interesting in
seeing these ruffians for themselves. They worked their way towards
the local pub known to be frequented by members of the gang. On
arrival they were attacked, and defeated seven of the members.
<a href="#bob">Bob</a> was able to put two of them to sleep, and the group
dragged them into the pub to question.</p>

<p>After some enhanced interrogation, they found of that the Redbrands
had a secret hideout underneath the manor, and also that they were
somehow connected to the abduction of Gundren.</p>

        <h3>3. The Next Step</h2>
        <h4>2019-10-29</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>The group of Redbrands that had attacked now dead, the group headed
back to the inn for a rest. Straight to bed they found themselves
awoken in the middle of the night to the sounds of people trying to
forcibly enter.</p>

<p><a href="#bob">Bob</a> worked his way out and was able to convince them that he
was a horrible scary beast and that they should leave. The raiders
decided to make their way to the woods and setup camp there for the
night rather than risk another attack in the town.</p>

<p>Awakening in the morning, the group decided they needed to pull the
problem up by the roots and made their way to the manor the Redbrands
were using as a hideout. They found the entrance unguarded, and
worked their way into the cellar.</p>

<p>There they discovered several of the Redbrands from the night before,
and quickly burnt them alive in their barracks. <a href="#keijo">Keijo</a> found
a trap in the upper part of the cellar and lept across it to find
several undead skeletons. After a close call dispatching them he
decided to rest on the other side of the trap and wait for the rest
of the group.</p>

<p>The other raiders found a hidden door that accessed a larger chamber.
Inside they encountered a Nothic, who they agreed to feed the bodies
of the Redbrands they&#39;d just &quot;cooked&quot; to.</p>

<p>Appreciative, the Nothic let the pass.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="session" id="session-3">
        <h3>4. Glasstaff</h2>
        <h4>2019-11-05</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After a bit more exploration the group discovered a few rooms leading
to where <a href="#keijo">Keijo</a> was resting. On reuniting they stormed the
adjacent cells and rescued the family inside.</p>

<p>Again, they bribed the Nothic (now given the nickname &quot;Noth&quot;) to
allow them to pass unmolested by feeding them several more Redbrand
bodies.</p>

<p>While <a href="#larry">Larry</a> safely escorted the family to the entrance,
<a href="#bob">Bob</a> discovered another secret door. Following this through,
they encountered a man with a glasstaff in a comfortable sitting
room.</p>

<p><a href="#larry">Larry</a> quickly put him on his knees with a blast of fire
magic, and disarmed the man, but not before he surreptitiously
charmed <a href="#keijo">Keijo</a>. The man attempted to convince them that he
was Iarno, and that he&#39;d been captured and held prisoner by the
ruffians. <a href="#keijo">Keijo</a> felt compelled to agree with this man, but
the rest of the group remained unconvinced.</p>

<p><a href="#bob">Bob</a>, nevertheless suggested that <a href="#keijo">Keijo</a> escort their
friend out. Slyly, as they were leaving <a href="#bob">Bob</a> put the pair
asleep, breaking the charm on <a href="#keijo">Keijo</a>.</p>

<p>On waking up they interrogated the man further, discovering that
Iarno and Glasstaff were one and the same. The bugbears knew the
location of the mine that Gundren sought.</p>

        <h3>5. No More Redbrands</h2>
        <h4>2019-11-18</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>With the knowledge of the bugbears, the group routed the rest of the
hideout. First, they commanded Iarno, through arcane means, to go
tell the remaining Redbrands to attack the bugbears.</p>

<p>After waiting several minutes they burst into the barracks to find
just that occuring. <a href="#bob">Bob</a> charmed two of the bugbears, leading
them away from the battlefield and getting them to reveal the
location of the wave echo cave.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Redbrands and other bugbears fought one another to the
death. At the end, the hideout was empty and the group had survived,
now knowing the location of the cave they sought.</p>

<p>They headed back to the inn for a rest.</p>

        <h3>6. Cragmaw Castle</h2>
        <h4>2019-12-17</h4>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After some rest, the Raiders decided that the best course of action
would be to rescue Gundren from Cragmaw Castle. While they already
knew the location of Wave Echo cave, they felt obligated to find the
dwarf who&#39;d hired them and brought them to Phandelin in the first
place.</p>

<p>They worked their way north of Phadelin and through the forest until
they reached the castle. Sneaking their way in they found King Grol&#39;s
chambers where he was discussing selling of the map to an agent of
the Black Spider, with the dwarf Gundren gagged and tied up in the
same room.</p>

<p><a href="#bob">Bob</a> managed the convince Grol that he was Glasstaff and the
other creature was impersonating agents of the Black Spider. The king
had the creature led out by hobgoblin guards and negotiated the
return of the map, and Gundren.</p>

<p>Though he was gravely injured, the group stabilised him and made
their way back to Phandelin so the dwarf could recouperate.</p>

        <h3>7. Wave Echo Cave 1</h2>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>After his convelescing, Gundren awoke and was grateful to the
Raiders. They quickly decided that they needed to make their way to
Wave Echo Cave, and finish the Black Spider.</p>

<p>Though still injured, Gundren agreed to accompany them. On arriving
they found one of Gundren&#39;s brothers dead in the entranceway. They
worked their way through the cave, finally arriving at what appeared
to be barraks, where they narrowly defeated a retinue of bugbear
guards.</p>

<p>Tired, and with resources constrained, the group now faced trying to
rest in the cave or pushing further to try to find Gundren&#39;s other
brother before the Black Spider could...</p>
