<h1>Goals for 2019</h1>

<h2>Top 3</h2>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Be healthier, mentally and physically, by systematically taking
care of myself.</li>
<li>[x] Reduce mortgage debt and de-risk general expenses aggressively.</li>
<li>[ ] Expand my mind by applying myself to some kind of artistic endeavour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health</h2>

<p>I will not allow malaise to prevent me from trying new things and stepping out
of my comfort zone.</p>

<h3>Self-Care</h3>

<p>I have never been studious at maintaining myself. Self-care is symbolic of my
internal valuation of myself. In improving that valuation is to improve my
self-care. Last year, I did this with flossing and brushing. This year, I will
do it with haircare and journaling.</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] Floss (almost) every day.</li>
<li>[x] Shave (almost) every day, and maintain a neat haircut.</li>
<li>[ ] Maintain a journal. Write at least 2 entries per week.</li>
<li>[x] Exercise regularly.

<ul>
<li>[x] Run, swim or cycle at least twice per week. Record the sessions.</li>
<li>[ ] Participate in 1 public event (city2surf, city2gong, etc)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Finances</h3>

<p>The last few years of finance have been focused solely on buying a house. Now
that we&#39;ve accomplished that, what&#39;s next? We&#39;re overexposed to the property
market and should be looking to pay down our debt as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally, I need to start thinking more about retirement, and planning for
my long term financial situation. This means looking at wills, considering
super plans, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] Have under $1mm in debt remaining on the house (roughly 7 years ahead on
payment schedule)</li>
<li>[ ] Create a legal will.</li>
<li>[ ] Move my super to Australia Super, and consolidate my AMP plans there.

<ul>
<li>[ ] Confirm life insurance is comparable.</li>
<li>[ ] Confirm any other remaining features on AMP are not important.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Art</h3>

<p>Some years have gone by with a token goal towards improving some kind of
artistic talent. These have always been de-prioritised. Often then neglect has
been because of my own insecurities about doing something that I don&#39;t think
I&#39;m naturally good at.</p>

<p>This year I will commit to practicing art regularly.</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Do some kind of art (any kind) at least 2 times per week. Track
this by using a calendar.</li>
</ul>
