is pretty stupid.</p>

<p>The Utopia of Rules laments the modern bureaucractic
construction, but doesn&#39;t do much in the way of providing
any alternatives; I suspect Graeber would suggest reading
anarchist literature for solutions.</p>

about. I was struggling to finish by about 70% of the way
through.</p>

<p>The first book did a good job setting up the characters, the
world, etc. And this book does exactly... nothing with them.</p>

<p>It also commits so many tropes that I nearly quit on that basis
alone.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mustache twirling villains that repeatedly show up and always
manage to get away.</li>
<li>Unambiguously good and bad sides.</li>
<li>Making characters so ultra-strong and intimidating and then
having to make EVEN MORE ultra strong and intimidating
characters so there&#39;s an actual threat.</li>

<p>No character building, the characters are literally NPCs. The
plot is a weird love letter to... Hollywood producers? There&#39;s
no real sci-fi and the core conceit is a time paradox that
(admittedly with self-awareness) is just handwaved away.</p>

way. Only towards the very end did I think it was dragging on a

                        <p>As a finale to the series, overall I found it pretty
disappointing. The book feels like all the problems of the
other books, but without the best bits.</p>

<p>The first half really dragged on without any direction and the
characters just felt like they were bouncing from one vignette
to the next.</p>

<p>The second half kickstarts a plot, but on the whole it just
doesn&#39;t feel engaging or interesting the way the other books
did.</p>

                        <p>Lots of interesting takes in this book. There are some areas
where I think he classes decisions as irrational (e.g. around
risk taking on EV for single events) when they are actually
rational in risk-weighted terms (i.e. some sharpe ratio type of
measure).</p>

<p>Things that may be irrational in an iterated scenario may be
perfectly rational in a once-offscenario (e.g. accepting $90
guaranteed instead of a 95% chance of $100). The second is a
better trade if you can make it repeatedly, but by risk ratio
the first is a better trade once-off.</p>

abbreviated, histories (e.g. Finland). Too much US-centric
views at the end, and ultimately an unsatisfying description of
how technology makes us more polarised - i.e. very &quot;boomer&quot;

<p>The book also avoids the most problematic issue women face in
the workplace (sexual harassment) for the majority of the book.</p>

                        <p>&quot;Disappointed&quot; is perhaps too strong of a word, but I did
struggle to finish this one. Ultimately, I still love the world
building and setting, but the plot and the characters felt
cheap and unearned this time.</p>

<p>Lysander is just magically amazing and perfect in every way,
despite a decade of isolation and opposing men and women who
were hardened veterens of a decades long war. Oh and apparently
he&#39;s psychic? So I guess that&#39;s a thing. Nevermind besting
Darrow - literally the most formidible fighter in the solar
system - in single combat by &quot;tricking&quot; him with a hidden
razor. Really? Darrow, king of combat by deceit, bested by a
trick from someone who&#39;s been in combat for less than a week?</p>

<p>The abomination comes out of nowhere and brings down the entire
republic by bribing a single politician.</p>

<p>The ascomanni appear as a deus ex machina from the kuiper belt
to put even further pressure on the republic. And, of course,
they&#39;re magically super powerful despite having been isolated
in deep spaces for centuries.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll still read the final book, but this one has really pushed
the bar down. Bad guys were invincible because they needed to
be for the plot.</p>

                        <p>Took me quite awhile to get into the flow in this book. The
beginning is very slow and there&#39;s lots of distractions and
world building. However, the middle of the book and the core
plot are incredible. Slake Moths are such great &quot;bad guys&quot; and
never felt tedious or contrived.</p>

<p>I wish that the book had either expanded more on some of the
other non-prime characters (the mayor, the crime boss, etc) or
dropped them entirely, since ultimately they didn&#39;t add much to
the book.</p>

the flood happens is a bit tedious. Trope-y inexplicably
invincible bad guy. Drags on for a very long time, and
ultimately has a pretty unsatisfying ending.</p>

great. The politiking, romance and world building are
fantastic.</p>

<p>After the main conceit of the plot is revealed, though, the
book just speeds into hyperdrive and misses a lot from it.</p>

<p>Overall good, but I think it would have benefited from being a
series instead of a single novel.</p>

How was this nominated for a Hugo award? I think this review on Amazon
just about sums it up...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a small wonder why this amazing story was nominated.
It explores the deeply convoluted aspects of love between
human and and another sentient species of unexpected
origin. The title does not do the text justice, as Tingle
pulls off a difficult subject with style and aplomb, taking
his place with ease among the greatest of sci-fi authors.&quot;</p>

                        <p>Some thought provoking essays. Plenty of &quot;outrage culture&quot;,
some of which seems more sensible than others. The bad essays
really took the momentum out of reading it from the good
essays, but overall was good.</p>

I love to have found an Aussie fantasy author that is really
great. The plot, the characters, the world building, all the
times when I thought there&#39;d be a horrible cliche and then
there wasn&#39;t. This book really has it all.</p>

Aside from the fact that the author hasn&#39;t published since
2013, and therefore is unlikely to ever(???) publish again; I
will definitely not be reading any further books in the series.</p>

                        <p>&#39;Shitty bookclub&#39; book for February. Well and truly one of the
whitest books I&#39;ve ever read. I&#39;m pretty sure that a characters
cries on average once every other page.</p>

                        <p>Way different feel than the previous trilogy. I really like
that Darrow became a bad guy and really demonstrated he has
flaws.</p>

<p>There&#39;s still quite a lot of exposition and handholding, but on
the whole it&#39;s so much darker and gritter than the last books.
I&#39;m keen to see where the series goes.</p>

Extremely well written, unsurprisingly. Still very sad, and

                        <p>So much boring filler, but the action and overall story are
enough to keep it moving forward. I can&#39;t believe the third
book is going to be even longer.</p>

                        <p>The start is a bit rocky. Really annoyed to find out that the
books are split into two parts each (book one is actually two
physical books!?).</p>

<p>The characters have really started to grow on me. The world is
interesting, and the magic/mysticism is present but not the
focus of the storytelling.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t stand the interludes. Can&#39;t stand the flashbacks.</p>

<p>The sci-fi component is interesting, though. Good world
building.</p>

eventually goes back to the style of the first book; action and
plotting.</p>

<p>The ending was &quot;bittersweet&quot; enough that the whole
story didn&#39;t feel tied together with a bow. Definitely the best
sci-fi I&#39;ve read in awhile. Here&#39;s hoping for a television
adaptation.</p>

                        <p>Way too many rollercoasters throughout the book and not enough,
proper, character development. In the second book of the
series, Brown expands the scope of the battle to the solar
system but the relationships between characters continues to
defy reasoning.</p>

<p>While Darrow&#39;s powers of invincibility in <em>Red Rising</em>
bordered on parody, the double-double-double-double crossings
going on throughout the story of <em>Golden Son</em> became tiresome.</p>

read in the last several years.</p>

<p>Both the world building, and the science are expanded on just
enough to give the world some mystery. The characters, by and
large, make rational decisions and have really human problems.
Can&#39;t wait to finish the rest of the series.</p>

<p>The romance is just as cringe-worthy as real, actual,
adolescent romance.</p>

                        <p>Finally! Some original fantasy that doesn&#39;t involve thousands
of pages of world-building snoozefests. More than anything the
series reminds me of the Avatar series; part magic, part coming
of age, and part political intrigue and mystery. Weaving all
three plots together was a satisfying, and mostly unexpected,
twist.</p>

are the biggest predictors of success&quot; is something that
ultimately is difficult to argue with.</p>

<p>The book fails to address the difference between extreme
performers, do some of them really just outwork the others? The
interlude about smarter, intentional practice, was particularly
infuriating since the unstated premise is that knowing how to
do so isn&#39;t a problem in its own right.</p>

<p>Eventually, the number of anecdata and interviews with
successful individuals becomes tiresome. The core take away was
the goal setting approach that Duckworth advocates for &mdash;
Maintain high-level goals and validate them with mid-level
goals.</p>

                        <p>It took over a year to finish, but finally happened. One of the
saddest and most uncomfortable things I&#39;ve ever read. Glory,
honour, pride are irrelevant. The war of the anyman is
pointless trauma and meaningless sacrifice. Where Catch-22
treated it with humour, Remarque treats it with brutal realism.</p>

                        <p>Phonetic spelling got much better in this book, and the
political overtones (herein: racism/discrimination) come to the
forefront. The characters continue to flesh themselves out,
both Vimes and Carrot being the most interesting.</p>

<p>Better than the first, definitely carrying on with the Watch
thread. How had I not read Pratchett before? I really see how
it&#39;s classic.</p>

                        <p>Clever, and funny. Fantastic writing. The phonentic spelling
got tedius, and led to a lot of confusion. The lack of chapters
and constant switching of settings was hard to follow in an
e-book where the separation wasn&#39;t clear enough.</p>

<p>Good enough to keep me reading the Discoworld series for at
least a few more books in the night&#39;s watch thread.</p>

focus. Lots of meandering around the pschye of the nation
post-9/11 and of the Bush administrations criminality.</p>

<p>The way the army handled Tillman&#39;s death was, of course,
literally criminal. However, I struggled to find meaning in
searching out his real cause of death. After all, he was killed
&mdash; like so many others &mdash; in an unjust war, in a
foreign land, following orders he didn&#39;t believe in. No matter
what the reason, he remains dead.</p>

the book are far too larger than life to be accurately

page-count. The best bits were about the history of pirates,
but they were few and far between.</p>

                        <p>Fascinating look at homicide in under-represented communities
of South L.A. Frustratingly long winded at times, though the
main story thread was gripping. One of the most thought
provoking theses is that over-policing blacks (and other
poor/minorities) for minor crimes, while simultaneously
under-policing for serious crimes such as murder is partially
what led to fear and hatred of the LAPD amongst these
communities.</p>

<p>The epilogue seemed divorced from the narrative of the rest of
the book.  That is to say, murder rates are dropping
precipitously in South L.A. even without drastic change in
policy. This is ascribed to better social security and health
care, but that seems too simple to me.</p>

                        <p>A humanising look at one of the right-wing monsters of the
post-9/11 era. Breivik&#39;s life is explored from beginning to
end, engagingly written and darkly fascinating.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting books of the year, to be sure. One
of the most interesting things to take away from this is how
little the extreme right&#39;s message has changed over the years -
Women are objects, brown people are fine as long as they don&#39;t
mix with whites or &quot; white culture &quot;, men should be
men and other toxic masculinity tropes.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but be left wondering how much impact the
slaughter of so many soon-to-be politicos has had on Norway&#39;s
future. Has Breivik&#39;s attack had a similar effect as Yitzhak
Rabin&#39;s assassination did in Israel?</p>

<p>Definitely one to recommend.</p>

technology has changed trading in the modern era.</p>

<p>I was unimpressed with much of the description of technologists
and their ethics, capabilities and responsibilities. Describing
shipping proprietary code owned by your employer offsite
against both criminal law and contractual obligations as
something many Wall Street techies did can be viewed either as
a gross misunderstanding or a depressing view into vocational
ethics.</p>

<p>The total lack of input from the side of HFT throughout the
book is a bit deafening, especially since the deeper an
understanding Brad Katsuyama and IEX get of HFT firms, the more
they realise that the bigger banks are the ones enabling many
of the more complicated trading strategies that favour HFT.
Despite this, HFT remains the villain throughout.</p>

was superb. The comedy style reminded me of the style in
Catch-22, though certainly less dark towards the end. The book
drags on a bit towards the end, but ultimately wraps itself up
nicely. Will be looking at more books by Jonasson.</p>

                        <p>Amazing! I&#39;ve never been so engaged with a book about the
history of mathematics. Dolnick spreads the context of the
age of discovery over every one of the unique personalities
involved. From Kepler &amp; Brahe to Newton &amp; Leibniz, the
transition from the classical world to the modern one is
told in fascinating detail.</p>

<p>Not only does Dolnick describe the how and why, but delves
deeply into their relationships and interactions. Has there
ever been a group so vain and so righteous in that vanity
than the early Royal Society?</p>

                        <p>A much more politically-centric continuation of the first book.
Largely I felt that Suarez didn&#39;t tackle the hard questions,
leaving the reader to suspend a substantial amount of disbelief
to arrive at the distributed utopia created by a machine AI
gone wild.</p>

<p>Ultimately I felt that the augmented reality &amp; gamification
ideas were fun, but derivative.</p>

<p>The series as a whole was fun, and engaging enough, but
ultimately lacked substance.</p>

                        <p>Surprising and twisting thriller. The book starts off as your
standard who-done-it thriller with a hard-boiled detective.
Eventually it departs from that and turns into more of a
sci-fi-cum-political story in the vein of Doctorow.</p>

<p>Some sections drag on, and the &quot; Bad Guys &quot; seem
unflinchingly successful or foiled only by a new technological
(literal) Deus Ex Machina.</p>

I thought necessary, and more than a little formulaic,
nevertheless &quot;-&quot; a guilty pleasure.</p>

<p>The premise of digitised humans, where the limiting factor is
cost, paints a world where only the rich can be both immortal
and all powerful.</p>

<p>The sex scenes were written for 14 year olds, and the hand to
hand combat references to karate and other Japanesisms were
eye-roll inducing. The who-done-it and raw grit of the story,
while predictable, did the genre justice in the future-tech
world.</p>

                        <p>A thought provoking foray into the pleasures and sorrows of the
military. Fick, as an ivy-league liberal, is convinced by the
ROTC recruiter to try a 10-week summer intro to the Marines
(pre-September 11th). In this he gets the itch of comraderie
and challenge.</p>

<p>One quote from the recruiter, in response to a comment from a
student about how having ROTC on campus went against the morals
of the school (paraphrased) &quot;- It&#39;s good that the ROTC is
on campus because the university needs to liberalize the
military&quot;</p>

<p>The middle of the book is largely a recounting of the 2002
invasion of Iraq from the perspective of a ground soldier, and
from a bloodthirsty American public. Ultimately I found this
part of the book too procedural, and found my interest waning.</p>

<p>As the book progresses towards the end, Fick becomes more and
more conservative. By the end (once he&#39;s finished his 4-year
stint) he&#39;s alienated his friends and family. They&#39;re unable to
understand his perspective, and he theirs.</p>

                        <p>Typical Bill Bryson wit can&#39;t rescue a topic that is relatively
devoid of factual information. The book can basically be
summarized as &quot;- We don&#39;t know much&quot;.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the book did a good job of addressing some of
the more pernicious of Shakespearean myths (he was multiple
persons, he was Lord Byron, etc). Some of the history of London
itself was interesting, and especially with respect to what I
know about Elizabethan society, some time was spend not just on
the court and the nobles, but on daily life.</p>

<p>Overall, not a disappointment, but not the best of Bill&#39;s work.</p>

really come together. I love the play with languages and the
broader themes feel very much like the The Foundation series.</p>

<p>The inner monologue of Justice of Toren made him the most
sympathetic character in the book. So many of the other
characters left me wondering about their motivations. Like a
William Gibson novel, the depth of the vernacular left me
confused for large portions &quot;-&quot; especially when talking
about gender.</p>

                        <p>Julian is such an inspired thinker. Both the interview and his
polemic against Eric Schmidt as commentary of the aftermath is
particularly insightful. The footnotes were often such a
distraction that I had a hard time following the thought train.</p>

<p>Assange&#39;s insights into Namecoin and Bitcoin were especially
interesting. I wish I would have read this interview years ago.

a fantasy epic, mostly readable series, and after spending a
bunch more time understanding the lore and history of Westeros
is even more interesting. The books start to slow as they get
deeper into world building, but the eschewing of fantasy tropes
keeps them engaging enough to continue.</p>

                        <p>Filled with irrational people and their problems. The way the
story unfolded was well executed, but the “twist” felt forced.</p>

<p>The characterisation of alcoholism was, I think, the best part
of the book, and Rachel&#39;s character kept me the most engaged.
Definitely an improbable amount of fucked-up people in such a
small vicinity of one another, though. The epilogue felt as if
the book had to have a happy ending.</p>

                        <p>Charming story, and a very interesting concept. Throughout the
book the only character that I didn&#39;t think was a total jerk
was Bee (the girl writing). Bernadette was a prima donna, too
focused on herself and judgemental of others.  The dad, out of
nowhere, went from foundation solid to off the rails crazy.</p>

<p>All of the other women were catty and gossipy, complete
stereotypes. Only once in the book did Bee finally recognise
the privilege that she was born into.</p>

<p>I loved the way the characters were explored, and the ending
was about as good as it possibly could have been.</p>

                        <p>Strong beginning, but wavers heavily towards the end. The
message that “normal” people have the opportunity to be great,
all they have to do is pay attention was paper thin. The
romance coming together at the end was cheesy.</p>

<p>However, being set in Sydney there was lots of interesting
Australian-isms.  Zusak, just like in The Book Thief, wrote
engagingly. I didn&#39;t really put the book down once I started,
but felt unsatisfied at the end.</p>

                        <p>A psychological thriller throughout. The first half or so was
extremely good, the explanation of the living planet and the
confusion oozes through the pages.</p>

<p>As the book procedes, though, it shifts its gaze increasingly
towards its navel. Pontificating on all kinds of
probably-philosophical-but-ultimately-boring existentialism.
Should have powered through the final half, but found it
extremely difficult. Not as clear a sci-fi statement on the
real world as most classics.</p>

                        <p>Fantastic story. I couldn&#39;t believe how much I enjoyed it. The
era when sports meant heart and not dollars is sadly past. The
back drop of the depression along with the coming tide of WWII
cast against west coast blue collar workers was fantastic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard not to be inspired by the story of Joe Rantz and the
other boys. It&#39;s hard not to be jealous of the kind of
comradery shown by the crew.</p>

<p>Grippingly written. Not a book to be put down.</p>

                        <p>Excellent twist, kept mostly hidden until the end (though at
the point the reader is surely starting to guess).</p>

<p>Moriarty himself describes Holmes as bumbling and childish
never really a rival at all shattering quite a lot of the
illusion.  Especially since... if he was really all that
brilliant - How did Devoreaux start to take over across the
pond to begin with?</p>

<p>Overall, a good book but disappointing following on the heals
of the first.  Here&#39;s hoping Horowitz makes a return to the
Holmesian style in the next edition.</p>

                        <p>Interesting take on the classic survival story. Mark Watney is
a bit of a campy character. Too much “lol&#39;ing”.  The survival
bits are fascinating, and the maths is cool. However, it
dragged on a bit longer than was necessary - and at every turn
something going wrong was tiresome. None of the other
characters were ever really explored (perhaps that was the
point).</p>

<p>Overall, it was a page turner. I finished it fast, unable to
put it down.</p>

                        <p>Brilliant new and riveting Holmes story. Nothing not to like
other than it ended. I&#39;m hopeful that Horwitz&#39;s other Holmes
books are as good.</p>

<p>The twist of how things connected at the end was unexpected,
including the wife-cum-killer and the husband pedophile.
Watson&#39;s internal narrative set the stage brilliantly. The only
thing that could have been added was more of an insight into
Holmes himself. But maybe that&#39;s the charm of the Sherlock
stories?</p>

                        <p>Very dense. Scott mentioned that he thought it was
crazy-super-dense even for Gibson, but I thought Neuromancer
was harder to get a grasp on. I really like the idea of the
past being a communicable place that rich plutocrats from the
future pillage. I thought the tech was mostly unimaginative,
but maybe that&#39;s my cynicism.</p>

<p>The “romance” between Flynn and Netherton was boring. Most of
the characters were underdeveloped. The ending happened too
abruptly (And then… everything worked out happily ever after!),
and the mystery and motivations of the bad guys was completely
undeveloped.</p>

<p>By the end, not much had really happened. There were many more
story threads than in the other two books, but only Saul&#39;s (the
lighthouse keeper) resonated in any way, and then only a bit.</p>
